    "description": "Factored out from 15402. While working on 14240 it has been noticed that EDN currently doesnt support backpressure from CSRNG when transmitting contents of the command FIFOs. As a result, whenever a RESGEN command contains more than 1 word of additional data, word 2 and 3 are dropped by CSRNG which then keeps waiting for the last two words forever.

As a result, the if condition evaluates to false and the check is considered to have passed, because the error is not thrown. Consider the following scenario: systemverilog logic 31:0 foo; foo  0; foo0  1bx; DV_CHECK_EQ(foo, 1)  Expectation: check should fail because none of the bits of foo are 1.  Reality: check passes just because the 0th bit is x. The rest of the bits are 0s.  In the above example, ideally we should have used the case equality macro. However, in practice, we have rampantly used logical equality versions of the DV_CHECK_ macros throughout our codebase. Also, DV engineers tend to use the non-case equality version of the check macros when one of the operands is a fixed constant. A safer approach is to NOT use a negative check - instead use a positive check with error being thrown in the else clause. systemverilog if (T_) ; else begin  throw error end  With this change, DV_CHECK_EQ(foo, 1) in the above example throws the error as expected. This makes DV_CHECK macros in line with an assert statement, because assert does a positive check, and throws an error thrown when the expression evaluates to false (i.e. the else clause). i.e., assert(foo  1) throws an error because the expression evaluates to false and it goes into else block (in case of a missing else block, the tool throws an error with a generic message). In our assert macros, we specify an else block to print a custom message: https:github.comlowRISCopentitanblobd19d492fcac39fe201469b3935c9cb11c979d5a9hwipprimrtlprim_assert_standard_macros.svhL10 We avoid using assert in DV code because it is sensitive to assertcontrol statements. With this change, the macros will now pessimistically fail when the operand of the expressions contains an unknown bit, forcing the DV engineer to address it first (perhaps a missing reset, or not properly initialized, etc).

At the chip level, however, the main_pok turns off less than a clock cycle after main_pd_n deasserts (i.e., pwrmgr requesting to enter low power). Based on AST modeling, the main_pok turns off MPPD_FDLY amount of time, which is 1us (https:github.comlowRISCopentitanblobf851c9ae04c5c411703d6792aa4471ab036ee01dhwtop_earlgreyipastrtlrglts_pdm_3p3v.svL66) when the low power entry request is received. This seems less, considering we are running the slow  AON clock at 200kHz (5us period). Filing an issue to confirm this is really right. The assertion failure occurs because at the offending clock edge, the assertion detects a 1 on main_pd_n and expects the main_pok to follow (i.e., 1). But on that edge, main_pd_n is 0, and less than 1 AON cycle later, main_pok has also already dropped. image(https:user-images.githubusercontent.com46467186130912778-966fd903-ab00-4f21-8411-03d8adcca6bd.png)",

Screenshot from 2021-05-11 14-13-35(https:user-images.githubusercontent.com16736281117885891-4986a780-b263-11eb-9728-192dfa54b2e9.png) As you can see even though the mode_i detects that the new entropy mode is from SW, the state machine remains in the EDN states. This causes the first keccak round to block until EDN request returns, even though the SW entropy is immediately available. Is there any requirement that entropy mode can only be switched from EDN to SW once a refreshing operation has completed, or is this an issue in the design Thanks, Udi",

    "description": "Factored out from 15402. While working on 14240 it has been noticed that EDN currently doesnt support backpressure from CSRNG when transmitting contents of the command FIFOs. As a result, whenever a RESGEN command contains more than 1 word of additional data, word 2 and 3 are dropped by CSRNG which then keeps waiting for the last two words forever. Similarly, EDN keeps waiting for the final ACK of CSRNG. Both IPs lock up. The waveform below shows this. csrng_req_ready goes low at the curser but EDN keeps updating the request bus csrng_req_bus. Words 1 and 2 of the seed (0x21CA8E3F and 0x5BA3DBA1) are not being picked up by CSRNG - they are missing in the rdata_o sequence at the bottom. cmd_len_q stays at 2 and CSRNG remains in the SendMOP state forever.

As a result, the if condition evaluates to false and the check is considered to have passed, because the error is not thrown. Consider the following scenario: systemverilog logic 31:0 foo; foo  0; foo0  1bx; DV_CHECK_EQ(foo, 1)  Expectation: check should fail because none of the bits of foo are 1.  Reality: check passes just because the 0th bit is x. The rest of the bits are 0s.  In the above example, ideally we should have used the case equality macro. However, in practice, we have rampantly used logical equality versions of the DV_CHECK_ macros throughout our codebase. Also, DV engineers tend to use the non-case equality version of the check macros when one of the operands is a fixed constant. A safer approach is to NOT use a negative check - instead use a positive check with error being thrown in the else clause. systemverilog if (T_) ; else begin  throw error end  With this change, DV_CHECK_EQ(foo, 1) in the above example throws the error as expected. This makes DV_CHECK macros in line with an assert statement, because assert does a positive check, and throws an error thrown when the expression evaluates to false (i.e. the else clause). i.e., assert(foo  1) throws an error because the expression evaluates to false and it goes into else block (in case of a missing else block, the tool throws an error with a generic message). In our assert macros, we specify an else block to print a custom message: https:github.comlowRISCopentitanblobd19d492fcac39fe201469b3935c9cb11c979d5a9hwipprimrtlprim_assert_standard_macros.svhL10 We avoid using assert in DV code because it is sensitive to assertcontrol statements. With this change, the macros will now pessimistically fail when the operand of the expressions contains an unknown bit, forcing the DV engineer to address it first (perhaps a missing reset, or not properly initialized, etc).

Crucially, vaddr is not connected. Currently the only usage of pma_checkers response is to set s2_pma when TLB is not ready, which is possible in some cases (e.g. if the type of memory operation is prefetch or fence). It seems to me that prefetches are not handled in DCache right now, and IIRC individual fences are not affected by PMAs So the pma_checker code path is mostly redundant If thats the case, can we remove them all together If thats not the case, then this may be a bug. This is found during the effort to convert rocket-chip to chisel3 (3110), which changed the bi-directional connection semantic to disallowing missing fields in either side of the connection.",

The issue seems to come from the following code (introduced in 2841): https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblobbf5742b9e353a80f501d43130218d3a444ec4b30srcmainscalarocketPTW.scalaL289 which, in turn, is evaluated after this condition: https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblobbf5742b9e353a80f501d43130218d3a444ec4b30srcmainscalarocketPTW.scalaL269 This behavior can be only observed in 64-bit Rocket cores (i.e., extending the configuration WithRV32 makes it disappear). Additional info: see the following (inconsistent) parameters: addr in PTWReq and vpnBits in HasTileParameters versus maxSVAddrBits and pgIdxBits in HasNonDiplomaticTileParameters . https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblobbf5742b9e353a80f501d43130218d3a444ec4b30srcmainscalarocketPTW.scalaL20-L25 https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblobbf5742b9e353a80f501d43130218d3a444ec4b30srcmainscalatileBaseTile.scalaL161-L182 https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblobbf5742b9e353a80f501d43130218d3a444ec4b30srcmainscalatileBaseTile.scalaL60-L63 If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce the problem: Use the following configuration in rocket-chip: scala package freechips.rocketchip.system import freechips.rocketchip.config.Config import freechips.rocketchip.subsystem._ class WithL2TLBs(entries: Int) extends Config((site, here, up)   case TilesLocated(InSubsystem)  up(TilesLocated(InSubsystem), site) map  case tp: RocketTileAttachParams  tp.copy(tileParams  tp.tileParams.copy( core  tp.tileParams.core.copy(nL2TLBEntries  entries))) case other  other  ) class TestRocketConfig extends Config( new WithL2TLBs(8)  new WithNSmallCores(1)  new BaseFPGAConfig)  Or use the following configuration in chipyard: scala package chipyard import freechips.rocketchip.config.Config class TestRocketConfig extends Config( new freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.WithNSmallCores(1)  new chipyard.config.AbstractConfig)  Note: chipyard enables L2 TLBs by default(https:github.comucb-barchipyardblobdcf8da4b2d3a4deead95462fce36a6db5693ed45generatorschipyardsrcmainscalaconfigAbstractConfig.scalaL48) in the AbstractConfig class. What is the current behavior Cannot generate systems WithNSmallCores when L2 TLBs are enabled. What is the expected behavior I would say that configurations using WithNSmallCores and setting nL2TLBEntries to anything different than 0 should work as they did in previous releases (i.e., before 2841, like chipyard 1.5.0) or when operating in 32-bit mode (i.e., WithRV32). However, the fact that this issue exists brings a couple of questions to my mind: - Does it make sense to enable L2 TLBs when not using virtual memory - Is the problem described above the intended behavior Am I missing something - Should this be reported in the chipyard repo instead (as it is indeed something that comes from its default configurations) Please tell us about your environment: -- (examples) - version: git commit hash - OS: Linux knight 4.4.0-92-generic 115-Ubuntu SMP Thu Aug 10 09:04:33 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNULinux -- - version: bf5742b9e353a80f501d43130218d3a444ec4b30 - OS: Linux alf-xps 5.4.0-100-generic 11318.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 7 15:02:59 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNULinux What is the use case for changing the behavior NA",

Gemmini outputs correct values but a bug is encountered in the TileLinktoAHB process and noticed this bug that might affect others who are also using this module. What is the current behavior The TileLinktoAHB module ignores the bit mask information and directly outputs whatever is on the a_bits_address. What is the expected behavior The hsize and haddr should be affected by a_bits_mask which contains the bit mask information. TileLinktoAHB module is not taking into account of the bit mask information. From the below waveform graph (top module is from Gemmini, bottom is TileLinktoAHB), the correct behavior should be: hsizehaddr changes according to a_bits_mask  so that only the portion of 8000_c9a0  thats not masked by a_bits_mask is output to haddr . but you can see that TileLinktoAHB is not taking into account of the bit mask information.

Effectively, it must be paired with a TLFIFOFixer, or it can generate illegal TileLink transactions (multiple outstanding transactions with the same source ID), and also return illegally-ordered AXI4 responses. This is a performance issue (only allowing one in-flight transaction severely limits AXI4 bandwidth, especially when paired with a high-latency TileLink memory system), and then turns into a logic bug when trying to fix the performance issue.  Expected behavior Right now, we depend on pairing an AXI4ToTL widget with an AXI4UserYanker to define the maxFlight parameter in AXI4ToTL. This defines the maximum supported in-flight transactions for each AXI ID. The Operation Ordering section of the TileLink spec says:  Within a TileLink network, there may be multiple outstanding operations inflight at any given time. These operations may be completed in any order. Section 5.1 of the AXI4 spec says:  All transactions with a given AXI ID value must remain ordered, but there is no restriction on the ordering of transactions with different ID values. These semantics are different between TileLink and AXI4, in particular AXI4 has special ordering restrictions within a single AXI ID. When maxFlight is set to 1, there are no ordering issues, since each AXI ID can only have a single transaction in flight at once, and there are no ordering constraints between transactions with different AXI IDs. In this case, the AXI4 ordering model matches TileLinks ordering model. However, once maxFlight exceeds 1, the AXI network depends on AXI4ToTL to maintain ordering of transactions within the same AXI ID, which is not the current behavior.  Current behavior (read requests) Looking at the example of read requests, this is the logic AXI4ToTL uses to generate multiple TileLink requests for AXI requests on a single AXI ID: scala val r_count  RegInit(Vec.fill(numIds)  UInt(0, width  txnCountBits) ) val r_id  if (maxFlight  1)  Cat(in.ar.bits.id, UInt(0, width1))  else  Cat(in.ar.bits.id, r_count(in.ar.bits.id)(logFlight-1,0), UInt(0, width1))   So, r_count is a vector of counters, one counter for each supported AXI ID. Heres the code for how those counters are incremented: scala val r_sel  UIntToOH(in.ar.bits.id, numIds) (r_sel.asBools zip r_count) foreach  case (s, r)  when (in.ar.fire()  s)  r : r  UInt(1)    As expected, whenever a request is sent, we increment the appropriate counter based on the AXI ID the request came from. To see the problem with this scheme, think of this setup: we support only 1 AXI ID (so numIds is 1), and we support two transactions in flight for this AXI ID (so maxFlight is 2). We receive two AXI read requests from this single AXI ID, back-to-back, and AXI4ToTL will happily issue two TileLink Get requests back-to-back, each with unique r_ids, since r_count is incremented after the first request. After sending the second request, r_count is incremented a second time, which means r_id returns to the original value used for the first TileLink Get request. Now, if the two responses come back out-of-order (maybe request 1 is a cache miss and request 2 is a cache hit), and theres another AXI request waiting to be sent, then when we send request 3, well re-use the same TileLink source identifier from request 1, which is still in flight. This is illegal, since all outstanding TileLink requests must be uniquely identifiable by their source IDs. So thats one problem with this system: we re-use TileLink source IDs when responses come back out-of-order, and this leads to the TileLink Monitors triggering assertions. Theres one more problem though: lets assume we fixed AXI4ToTL so that it would only issue TileLink requests with valid source IDs when an out-of-order response came back. This response is still invalid from the AXI4 masters perspective, because it expects all of its requests from a single AXI ID to turn into well-ordered responses. Thus, AXI4ToTL would need re-ordering logic for all outstanding read requests within a single AXI ID to convert the out-of-order TileLink read responses into in-order AXI read responses.  Current behavior (write requests) The write request logic in AXI4ToTL is the same as the read request logic, so it will encounter the same TileLink-source-reuse bug as described above. However, I dont believe the other logical bug (relative ordering of transactions within a single AXI ID) will be an issue. This is what the AXI4 specification has to say about write transaction ordering within an AXI ID:  The data transfers for a sequence of write transactions with the same AWID value must complete in the order in which the master issued the addresses Im not sure what restrictions this will place on how we issue TileLink Put requests, or how we re-order (or dont re-order) AXI4 write responses. Do we have to re-order AXI4 write responses in case write requests complete out-of-order Do we need to ensure the TileLink interconnect will reflect those TileLink Put requests in-order Im not sure what the correct behavior is for this case, Ive mostly put my time into thinking about the read-request scenario.  How to replicate It looks like most use-cases for AXI4ToTL implicitly use the TLFIFOFixer, so this isnt a logical issue. However, Ill give an example of replicating this for the NVDLA. Periphery.scala for the NVDLA(https:github.comucb-barnvdla-wrapperblob412da40b054238126856049a3530e397902a925dsrcmainscaladevicesnvdlaPeriphery.scalaL17) uses the fromMaster method(https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblob00d9e02c1901d0285f22eefec7c25073fb90e4f1srcmainscalatilelinkBusWrapper.scalaL328-L335) to connect to the fbus, which implicitly inserts a TLFIFOFixer. If you instead use coupleFrom(https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblob00d9e02c1901d0285f22eefec7c25073fb90e4f1srcmainscalatilelinkBusWrapper.scalaL90-L91), then the TLFIFOFixer will disappear. Running an NVDLA workload will reveal this logical bug.  Ideas for resolution Some of this is addressed in the previously-linked Chipyard Google Group discussion, but heres the summary: - Ive implemented a straightforward design which has a number of limitations (doesnt support multi-beat AXI4 bursts, read-response-reordering space scales poorly with outstanding transactions and AXI4 IDs). - zhemao gave some great ideas on how to improve the space scaling issues, and Ive mostly implemented that design. - Im unsure of how to resolve the inevitable space-scaling issues when supporting multi-beat bursts. Perhaps this is inevitable, but maybe we should give users the option to restrict the max AXI4 burst length (theres a mechanism for this for TileLink, but not really for AXI4). Please tell us about your environment: - Chipyard release 1.3 - Ubuntu 18.04 What is the use case for changing the behavior Improved AXI4 performance",

The Gemmini submodule is at commit f13847e8. Issue Description: The standard tiled_matmul_ws-baremetal test completes successfully. However, when I run tests that include more complex operations like softmax or layernorm, the simulation consistently fails with an assertion error in ReservationStation.scala.

My Analysis: The assertion assert(entries_st(issue_id).valid) suggests that the reservation station is receiving an instruction to issue an entry that is not valid. Since this only occurs for workloads with softmaxlayernorm, it seems related to how these specific micro-operations are scheduled or tracked within Gemminis pipeline. Could someone please provide insight into what might be causing this assertion failure I would also appreciate any recommendations for further debugging steps, such as specific signals to trace or configuration changes to try. Thank you for your time and assistance.  Expected Behavior It should print cycles.  Other Information _No response_",

FPGA Platform: The issue is observed when running on the VU19P FPGA. Workload Configuration: The code being used is in the prototype configuration, with the firemarshal-generated br-linux.  Current Behavior The Valid signal from the prefetcher remains high, blocking the CPU from responding to the main pipelines requests and leading to a deadlock.  Expected Behavior The prefetcher should not assert the Valid signal continuously, allowing the main pipeline to process its memory access requests without encountering a deadlock.  Other Information Rocket cores stride prefetcher is causing a deadlock by continuously asserting the Valid signal. This prevents the CPU from properly responding to the main pipelines requests. When the prefetch unit and the main pipeline try to access the same cache line, the prefetcher keeps its Valid signal high, which prevents the CPU from processing the main pipelines memory access requests, causing a deadlock situation. img width2508 height335 altImage srchttps:github.comuser-attachmentsassetsfe5c71db-2073-4ae5-9440-5ef6455eae2a",

Current Behavior I have ported a NVDLA testcase to C and try to run it on RocketChipNVDLA large FPGA. At the stage of init, the testcase program write predifined feature and weight data to dedicate ddr(Cacheable) space, 0xC000B800(size 0x8000) and 0xC0002700(size 0x9000)and then the program setup some NV REGS and run. I find that NVDLA can not read the mentioned data correctly(even different between test case runs).And the result output is error because of this bug. Then I tried to flush the cache before set NVDLA REG to go, the result is correctly.  Expected Behavior NVDLA read the data in cache correctly.

conda-forge  Other Setup Ex: Prior steps taken  Documentation Followed  etc...  Current Behavior I am developing a custom MMIO device and testing it on chipyard using Verilator. In the custom MMIO device that am developing, I dependent on a Blackbox (System Verilog) for some parts of module. I am running normally: make run-binary-debug LOADMEM1 BINARYmyBinary.riscv CONFIGMyCustomConfig After doing all the intensive tests on my module, I tried to run: make run-binary LOADMEM1 BINARYmyBinary.riscv CONFIGMyCustomConfig And suddenly my module is not working correctly anymore I am not sure what changes between the two builds, but as I understood debug should only extra generate a vcd file for the waveforms.  Expected Behavior I am expecting make-binary and make-binary-debug to act the same  Other Information _No response_",

Current Behavior Hi Community, Our team is taping out a chipyard based design and we have confusion on the JTAG interface. Currently, it seems that the iobinder for HasPeripheryDebug punched out only JTAGChipIO(4 wires) out of chip. After going thru the code, it seems that the ndreset are left unconnected, this means that the debugger can not write ndmreset field of dmcontrol to reset the whole system(except the DTM AND DM), also the system.resetctrl.hartResetReq seems also unconnected, indicating that we can not reset the specific hart by asserting hartreset in dmcontrol. So, If we leave the iobinder as it currently is, does this mean that there is no way for debuggers to forcefully reset the whole system or a speicific hart. Since this is our first tapout, I wonder if this is the default debugging configuration for other team that had tapped out chipyard based design before. Can anyone shed some light into this Any help will be appreciated. Thanks for you work.  Expected Behavior See above  Other Information _No response_",

All 200 GB of swap memory in my Ubuntu setup gets consumed, then ubuntu kills openroad.  Expected Behavior Memory will stay within a reasonable range during the place stage.

Then, the device simply read the user field (MyUserField) and put it to the data field of the response. In DCache where the read request is created, lower one byte of target address is stored in the user field. Therefore, I expected for the program to print 0x8 and 0x10 but the current results are both 0x0.  Test Result sh UART UART0 is here (stdinstdout). Start TLUserField Test... Read 0x30008, result: 0x0 Read 0x30010, result: 0x00   Expected Behavior See the current behavior section.  Other Information I debugged my self and figure out the reason. In Xbar (Xbar.scala), user fields of in and out are not connected even if there are custom user field. My suggestion is that Xbar connects user field if there are list of the custom user field. Ive attached the patch that Id like to contribute. Please review my bug report and solution. If you like my device (TLUserFieldReader) and related codes, it would good to be part of chipyard examples. There might be misunderstanding something about this issue.

Output of clang --version is: Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4) Target: arm64-apple-darwin23.5.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: ApplicationsXcode.appContentsDeveloperToolchainsXcodeDefault.xctoolchainusrbin (I am using clang for compilation, not any version of gcc.) All software is up-to-date as of 27 May 2024. The RISC-V toolchain and tools have been installed from Homebrew:   Formulae riscv-software-srcriscvriscv-gnu-toolchain  riscv-software-srcriscvriscv-isa-sim  riscv-software-srcriscvriscv-openocd  riscv-software-srcriscvriscv-pk  riscv-software-srcriscvriscv-tools   I am using Verilator 5.024 2024-04-05 rev UNKNOWN.REV albeit with a slight hack to get around Issue 5031(https:github.comverilatorverilatorpull5031) - yes, it is currently troublesome to get verilator working under the latest Sonoma and Clang updates on MacOS .  Other Setup Step 0: Install RISC-V tools via Homebrew (see OS Setup section). Also, install _gnu-sed_, _jq_ and _help2man_. Possible other packages that escape me now ... Step 1: Setting up environment variables. I am using my own handwritten script here due to installing RISC-V tools and toolchain from Homebrew and using a custom-compiled verilator. bash  Avoids issues due to different options for sed on MacOS.  Requires gnu-sed to be installed via homebrew. export PATHopthomebrewoptgnu-sedlibexecgnubin:PATH  Use RISC-V toolchain installed via homebrew.  Requires riscv-gnu-toolchain to be installed via homebrew. export RISCVopthomebrewoptriscv-gnu-toolchainbin  Sets additional include paths export CPPFLAGS-Iopthomebrewoptriscv-isa-siminclude  Need to link verilator simulation executable. export LDFLAGS-Lopthomebrewoptriscv-isa-simlib  Step 2: Patch common-sim-flags.mk by removing -stdc17 from SIM_CXXFLAGS. Long story short, we need to compile verilator code with -stdc20 in order to circumvent Issue 5031(https:github.comverilatorverilatorpull5031) . My patched verilator does that, but this is for a different issue. Step 3: Enter simsverilator and run make.  cd simsverilators make  Step 4: Run the verilator simulation executable. I.e.,  .simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig rv64ui-p-simple  assuming that rv64ui-p-simple (from riscv-tests(https:github.comriscv-software-srcriscv-tests) is located in the current directory.  Current Behavior On my system, this results in an immediate Segmentation Fault.  .simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig RISCV_TESTSrv64ui-p-simple UART UART0 is here (stdinstdout). zsh: segmentation fault .simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig RISCV_TESTSrv64ui-p-simple  Attached is a relevant extract from the MacOS Diagnostic report. image(https:github.comucb-barchipyardassets747710254f16179-adf2-4f31-a816-91f578a028e6)  Expected Behavior Perform simulation and do not crash.  Other Information I have already debugged and somewhat fixed the issue. The culprit, as can be seen from the stack trace, is  generatorssrcmainresourcestestchipipcsrcSimTSI.cc  The code: c in_valid  tsi-in_valid(); in_bits  tsi-in_bits(); out_ready  tsi-out_ready();  (see https:github.comucb-bartestchipipblob104df6a81fd989cd4cad69b699894664fcf93c05srcmainresourcestestchipipcsrcSimTSI.ccL59-L61) is unsafe. tsi-in_bits(); implicitly calls the std::queue::front() methodfunction whose behavior is undefined if the queue is empty. Hence, replace the above, for instance, by c in_valid  tsi-in_valid(); in_bits  in_valid  tsi-in_bits() : 0; out_ready  tsi-out_ready();  to avoid the crash. (The above code is not thread-safe though, perhaps it does not need to be ...) Note: I have not tried if this is an issue under UbuntuLinux. My suspicion is that there, the program would just continue with some arbitrary value for in_bits. Semantically, anything can happen once we enter undefined behavior, so the above fix is advised either way PS: I apologize for just realizing that this bug report may have been better submitted in the testchipip(https:github.comucb-bartestchipip) repository.",

conda-forge  details  Other Setup Followed the setting up the repository guide, and added this to PeripheralDeviceConfigs.scala: scala class TapNICRocketConfig extends Config( new chipyard.harness.WithSimNetwork  new icenet.WithIceNIC  new freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.WithNBigCores(1)  new chipyard.config.AbstractConfig)   Current Behavior When I run: make -C simsverilator CONFIGTapNICRocketConfig VERILATOR_THREADS1 with any number of threads larger than 1, I end up with a simulator program that dies with a SIGSEGV almost as soon as I can launch it. As a consequence (and, to address what Im _really_ after), running the pingd.c test results in a 2s ping on my system. Thats longer than the default interval of a second, which means that running ping with no arguments against the single-threaded RTL simulation is an effective DOS strategy as it sends ICMP echo requests at about 2x the throughput the simulator can maintain.  Expected Behavior Simply, I expected to be able to throw more threads at it, as most of the time seems to be going to front-end stalls due to icache misses, something that multiple threads addresses nicely by way of expanding the effective available icache space. More broadly, I suppose I expected there to be a way to get to workable performance of the RTL model for functional simulation of simple network nodes without custom hardware, proprietary software, or an FPGA-equipped cloud instance. Perhaps my expectation that such a path exists through verilator is worth discussing here, too  Other Information coredumpctl debug suggests this is because the thread-local context_t isnt fully initialized in all threads:  Core was generated by homesethCodesrcgithub.comucb-barchipyardsimsverilatorsimulator-chipya.

The thread calling eval() provides one of those threads, and the generated model will create and manage the other N-1 threads.  ...  When making frequent use of DPI imported functions in a multithreaded model, it may be beneficial to performance to adjust the --instr-count-dpi(https:veripool.orgguidelatestexe_verilator.htmlcmdoption-instr-count-dpi) option based on some experimentation. This influences the partitioning of the model by adjusting the assumed execution time of DPI imports. And the latter bit suggests to me that while under some conditions the DPI functions may be called from the same threads, I see no guarantees that DPI from the always blocks in a module will be called using the same thread as the initial blocks (which the current implementation implicitly assumes). I suspect that one more degree of refinement around the models threads ought to be more compatible with the fesvrs coroutine implementation backing the DPI SimNetwork implementation would help here, not least in identifying whether this is even a crash that chipyard itself has any leverage over. Im opening this here because I believe its the right home for this issue, since it seems that even if verilator or fesvr exposed a callback or config option that would affect the outcome thered still need to be a change here in chipyard to take advantage of it, but Im very new to this space and would welcome your guidance.",

Current Behavior When building the default vcu118 image, the SD interface times out in the bootrom. It was observed working with Chipyard 1.8.1. It does work as expected on the VC707 and Arty100T when built with the SD interface enabled.  Expected Behavior It is expected that the bootrom goes through a series of cmds and copies the executable from the SD card to main memory. Example:  INIT CMD0 CMD8 ACMD41 CMD58 CMD16 CMD18 LOADING 128kB PAYLOAD .... BOOT   Other Information _No response_",

Please see the full stack trace below.  Expected Behavior Im not sure if JTAG is available in VCU118 yet. I think if boards config does not have WithNoDebug, it supports JTAG. However, VCU118 does include WithNoDebug and the exception occurs when I build the bistream after removing that config. My questions are: Is JTAG not available yet If it is available, how can I set or modify the code If it is not available, whats your plan for it  Other Information IOCells generated by IOBinders:

Now the question is, how and where is hwacha supposed to be defined adding lazy val hwacha  (project in file(hwacha)) .settings(commonSettings) .settings(publishArtifact : false) to build.sbt has not helped Im not entirely sure how to proceed. I have not been able to find other repos that publicly use hwacha nor have I found any documentation on adding hwacha to a rocket core within chipyard that demonstrates how to instantiate a hwacha object. Rocket-chip by default uses hardfloat, but hardfloat is already included within the rocket-chip file, where as hwacha is not. I have also tried moving the hwacha file to the Rocket-chip file, but that just causes all sorts of package namespace issues, and am also pretty confident that that is not the correct way to instantiate a hwacha module. Sort of stumped. Would really appreciate some help. Thanks  Expected Behavior verilator make runs fine and executres custom hwacha opcodestests.  Other Information _No response_",

Sometimes this is due to users having a non-interactive bash setup v.s. an interactive one. This can be solved by adding source homeeecsabe.gonzalezminiforge3etcprofile.dconda.sh to the env.sh.

EMULATOR OPTIONS no longer shows the command line options like --cycle-count, --vcd, etc.:  EMULATOR OPTIONS Consult emulator.cc if using Verilator or VCS documentation if using VCS for available options.  However, when checking emulator.cc, I can clearly see the command line options that are expected: c static void usage(const char  program_name)  printf(Usage: s EMULATOR OPTION... VERILOG PLUSARG...

At the bottom, I see an error:  terminate called after throwing an instance of std::invalid_argument what(): User queried htif_t help text  And lastly, 3. using the command line options that are described in emulator.cc, and that _used_ to work, are no longer recognized. For example:   .simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig-debug --vcdout.vcd ....testshello.riscv UART UART0 is here (stdinstdout). .simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig-debug: unrecognized option --vcdout.vcd terminate called after throwing an instance of std::invalid_argument what(): Unknown argument (did you mean to enable permissive parsing)   Expected Behavior I expect the help text to display something like this (Ran from chipyard release 1.9.1):   .simulator-chipyard-RocketConfig-debug --help Usage: .simulator-chipyard-RocketConfig-debug EMULATOR OPTION...

I have looked into changing chipyardfpgasrcmainresourcesvcu118sdbootsd.c but I am unsure how I would need to change PAYLOAD_SIZE_B and BBL_PARTITION_START_SECTOR.

This problem occurred somewhere between tags 1.8.1 and 1.9.0 because the same makefile flow works fine on Chipyard version 1.8.1 but fails on version 1.9.0 and above. It should be noted that no problem is observed when UInt data type is supplied to Queue. The main issue is that the flow for SInt-based Queue is broken.

Before running the script, I made two preparations: first, I created a new env.h file in nvdla-base directory, which specifies the path of liunx, and its content is as follows:  export FIREMARSHAL_LINUX_SRCPWD....firemarshalboardsdefaultlinux export LINUXSRCFIREMARSHAL_LINUX_SRC  Secondly, I switched the branch in Linux to nvdla-linux-v57.

Current Behavior Im using veriator to run programs under the proxy kernel and they are not executing properly.  (homesenchipyard.conda-env) sen2102c8722001:chipyardsimsverilator .simulator-chipyard-CustomGemminiSoCConfig pk -p a.out This emulator compiled with JTAG Remote Bitbang client. To enable, use jtag_rbb_enable1. Listening on port 32983 UART UART0 is here (stdinstdout). bbl loader  I will describe exactly what happened. When I run the program in proxy kernel mode, the program runs very slowly and it takes a long time before the bbl loader appears. After that there is no output.Although this is gemminis emulator, I think it might be a chipyard problem,and it should take longer to get a reply from gemmini.Or there may be experienced people here to help me.In the baremetal environment, there is no problem, and it runs successfully in a while.I really hope someone can help me solve this problem.  Expected Behavior The program runs successfully.  Other Information _No response_",

Current Behavior I want to evaluate a 32bit deisgn configuration(just add WithRV32 in the RocketVCU118Config) on vcu118. I thought this is a reasonable try.  class WithRV32 extends Config((site, here, up)   case XLen  32 case RocketTilesKey  up(RocketTilesKey, site) map  r  r.copy(core  r.core.copy( fpu  r.core.fpu.map(_.copy(fLen  32)), mulDiv  Some(MulDivParams(mulUnroll  8))))  )  Also I changed the sbboot bootrom Makefile so that the default botrom is compiled as a rv32 program:  CFLAGS-marchrv32imac -mcmodelmedany -O2 -stdgnu11 -Wall -nostartfiles CFLAGS -fno-common -g -mabiilp32 -DNONSMP_HART0  Also, it seems that gcc toolchain provided by chipyard 1.8.0 does not have multilib support by default, therefore I changed the RISCV variable to a gcc toolchian (downloaded from sifive websitw)with multilib support, and run the make flow. The bitstream and sdboot bin file are generated without errors. But after program it down to the vcu119 board, the uart console on host(baudrate set to 115200) does not display anything. But when I remove the WithRV32  config fragment(and changed the sdboot makefile back), the UART console display the process of booting correctly. Therefore I wonder what can be done to support 32bit configuration on vcu118. Is there any further tweaks needs to be done. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.  Expected Behavior RV32 configuration should be working on vcu118 prototyping  Other Information _No response_",

Based on some experiments it seems like this is caused by the omission of -top TestDriver in VCS command options. In the previous version of Chipyard -top TestDriver is specified. Not sure why this changes an error to a warning. Commit 83764d3 modified sim.mk to dump out sim-inputs.yml without tb_name(https:github.comucb-barchipyardblob10c26250c8ad71a6bb7ff5c30f365f8655338c8fvlsisim.mkL11), which removes the -top  option from VCS invocation when running make sim-rtl. harrisonliew What is the reason for this And is there a way to specify -top I tried setting sim.inputs.tb_name in my yaml but it looks like sim-inputs.yml takes precedence. I know I can try to avoid having duplicated definitions but its often involving PDKs so takes more work to resolve.",

For now, this commit avoids module collisions: https:github.comucb-barchipyardpull1369commits08839930009a6f15f2b3ba73940c243d34750ab6 but the proper fix is to uniquify modules that are common to the topmodel into separate files. When this bug is fixed, this hack can be removed.  Motivating Example Gate-level simulation is altered due to this bug. If synthesized modules are referenced in the models hierarchy and timing annotation is turned on, it is uncertain if the timing at the topmodel boundary will still be OK.

I havent exhaustively checked the differences, but I can see that when ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS1, the SRAMs in top.mems.conf are much narrower. To reproduce:   make -C simsvcs ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS1 verilog ...  mv simsvcsgenerated-src simsvcsgenerated-src.custom-firrtl-pass-enabled  make -C simsvcs verilog ...  cat simsvcsgenerated-srcchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfigchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig.top.mems.conf name cc_dir_ext depth 1024 width 136 ports mrw mask_gran 17 name cc_banks_0_ext depth 16384 width 64 ports rw name data_arrays_0_ext depth 512 width 256 ports mrw mask_gran 8 name tag_array_ext depth 64 width 88 ports mrw mask_gran 22 name tag_array_0_ext depth 64 width 84 ports mrw mask_gran 21 name data_arrays_0_0_ext depth 512 width 128 ports mrw mask_gran 32  cat simsvcsgenerated-src.custom-firrtl-pass-enabledchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfigchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig.top.mems.conf name cc_dir_0_ext depth 1024 width 17 ports mrw mask_gran 17 name cc_banks_0_ext depth 16384 width 64 ports rw name data_arrays_0_0_ext depth 512 width 8 ports mrw mask_gran 8 name tag_array_0_ext depth 64 width 22 ports mrw mask_gran 22 name tag_array_0_0_ext depth 64 width 21 ports mrw mask_gran 21 name data_arrays_0_0_0_ext depth 512 width 32 ports mrw mask_gran 32  You can see that each SRAM is much narrower (the width field is smaller) for the design where ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS1. It looks like the design instantiates several parallel instances of each SRAM to make up the same design as when ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS is unset. Im not sure if the two designs are functionally identical, but even if they are, using narrower SRAMs could be a problem if users were hoping to use particular foundry SRAMs with wider entries.  Expected Behavior I would expect the ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS1 build to produce the same Verilog for the RocketConfig as when ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS is unset.

toolchain following these https:github.comucb-barriscv-tools-feedstock directions - appeared to not do anything Also removed chipyard entirely, reinstalled, and tried again, which also didnt work.  Current Behavior Chipyard successfully generates verilog RTL, then goes into the vcs simulation script and appears to get most of the way through the simulation setup process before attempting to create executables (presumably using the riscv gcc compiler not entirely certain if its making riscv executables to run on the simulated chip or making x86_64 executables to run on the host machine) and then exiting because ld fails to find -lnuma and exits with status 1, which causes the make run (run by make CONFIGTapeoutDoubleMedConfig) to exit with status 2.  Expected Behavior Expected behavior is for ld to find -lnuma and therefore not fail.

It looks like well need an extra scalac option to fix the issue. To reproduce, take this code snippet from the Chisel Hierarchy Cookbook(https:www.chisel-lang.orgchisel3docscookbookshierarchy.htmlusing-definition-and-instance), and place it at the end of generatorschipyardsrcmainscalaexampleGCD.scala: scala import chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Definition, Instance, instantiable, public instantiable class AddOne(width: Int) extends Module  public val in  IO(Input(UInt(width.W))) public val out  IO(Output(UInt(width.W))) out : in  1.U  class AddTwo(width: Int) extends Module  val in  IO(Input(UInt(width.W))) val out  IO(Output(UInt(width.W))) val addOneDef  Definition(new AddOne(width)) val i0  Instance(addOneDef) val i1  Instance(addOneDef) i0.in : in i1.in : i0.out out : i1.out   Try to compile, and you should see these errors:  info compiling 1 Scala source to pathtochipyardgeneratorschipyardtargetscala-2.13classes ... error pathtochipyardgeneratorschipyardsrcmainscalaexampleGCD.scala:224:6: value in is not a member of chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Instancechipyard.example.AddOne error did you mean isA error i0.in : in error  error pathtochipyardgeneratorschipyardsrcmainscalaexampleGCD.scala:225:6: value in is not a member of chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Instancechipyard.example.AddOne error did you mean isA error i1.in : i0.out error  error pathtochipyardgeneratorschipyardsrcmainscalaexampleGCD.scala:225:15: value out is not a member of chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Instancechipyard.example.AddOne error i1.in : i0.out error  error pathtochipyardgeneratorschipyardsrcmainscalaexampleGCD.scala:226:15: value out is not a member of chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Instancechipyard.example.AddOne error out : i1.out error  error four errors found error (Compile  compileIncremental) Compilation failed   Expected Behavior I would expect the above code to compile without error.

Consider this test C program (which I placed in testshello.c): c int main()  return -1;   I built this program with make -C tests hello.riscv. When running with Verilator (make -C simsverilator run-binary CONFIGRocketConfig BINARYpathtochipyardtestshello.riscv), the stderr log file (simsverilatoroutputchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfighello.out) ends with these two lines:   FAILED  (tohost  -1)  FAILED  (code  -1, seed 1670529991) after 10634 cycles  Furthermore, the process exits with status 2, so a shell process can tell the test failed. When running with VCS (make -C simsvcs run-binary CONFIGRocketConfig BINARYpathtochipyardtestshello.riscv), the stderr log file (simsvcsoutputchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfighello.out) ends with these two lines:   FAILED  (tohost  -1)  PASSED  Completed after 11313 simulation cycles  Furthermore, the process exits with status 0, so a shell process _cant_ tell the test failed.  Expected Behavior The VCS simulation should behave the same as the Verilator simulation: it should report the failure cause, and exit with a non-zero status code.  Other Information Some background on why this happens: The Verilator and VCS simulations are driven by two different testbench files (although perhaps that will change after 1263 is resolved). The Verilator simulation is driven by emulator.cc(https:github.comucb-barchipyardblob43b75640cc5f5c95ede218e53f39976a96623c0fgeneratorschipyardsrcmainresourcescsrcemulator.cc) in the Chipyard repo, while the VCS simulation is driven by TestDriver.v(https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblob21722ddd51957f43b933f910f34b9c645fa54226srcmainresourcesvsrcTestDriver.v) in the rocket-chip repo. As I recall, returning a non-zero exit code from a C program causes the RISC-V core to write the exit code to a special tohost memory-mapped address, which causes the FESVR(https:github.comriscv-software-srcriscv-isa-sim) to interpret that data as a system call, and print this error message(https:github.comriscv-software-srcriscv-isa-simblob9b074198357b77189df989f0e274b23353f7f528fesvrsyscall.ccL204) (which we see as the second-to-last line in both simulation logs).  Verilator This code at the end of emulator.cc(https:github.comucb-barchipyardblob43b75640cc5f5c95ede218e53f39976a96623c0fgeneratorschipyardsrcmainresourcescsrcemulator.ccL363-L386) checks for the various causes of why the test might halt, and reports the exit code. Note that this file is directly interrogating tsi-exit_code(), and using that to set the exit status.  VCS The signals of interest in TestDriver.v are failure and success(https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblob21722ddd51957f43b933f910f34b9c645fa54226srcmainresourcesvsrcTestDriver.vL116-L117). Note that both of them are 1-bit signals. The failure signal is only written after a simulation timeout(https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblob21722ddd51957f43b933f910f34b9c645fa54226srcmainresourcesvsrcTestDriver.vL137-L141), so thats the only way to have the VCS simulation report a non-zero exit code. The success signal also causes the simulation to end, but the result is the test-passed message and a 0 exit code(https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblob21722ddd51957f43b933f910f34b9c645fa54226srcmainresourcesvsrcTestDriver.vL150-L160). The success signal is driven by the TestHarness module, and has a variety of drivers depending on how the DUT is set up. However, those drivers can only ever tell the TestHarness to pass the test, never to fail it (or what the failure cause was). For this particular test, the test is finished when the SimSerial(https:github.comucb-bartestchipipblobf99b1eb59a34d7934059904f03237d5bc8d4a680srcmainresourcestestchipipvsrcSimSerial.v) module in the testchipip repo reports an exit code from the TSI block(https:github.comucb-bartestchipipblobf99b1eb59a34d7934059904f03237d5bc8d4a680srcmainresourcestestchipipcsrcSimSerial.cc). However, SimSerial only gets the LSB of the TSIs exit code(https:github.comucb-bartestchipipblobf99b1eb59a34d7934059904f03237d5bc8d4a680srcmainresourcestestchipipvsrcSimSerial.vL65), so it doesnt know if TSI wants the test to pass or fail.  Path Forward I dont know exactly how we want to resolve this lack-of-information getting to TestDriver.v, but here is a possibility. - Change the interface between SimSerial and the TestHarness infrastructure, so we dont just have a success signal to drive, but perhaps a finish bit and exit_code value. Then TestDriver could examine the two together, and determine if the test should pass or fail. - This would require changing SimSerial to read the entirety of __exit from TSI. Additionally, wed have to update some of the TestHarnessHarnessBinders code to use these new finishexit_code signals. Finally, wed have to update TestDriver to interpret these signals appropriately and print out the right message (similar to the simulation-finish logic at the end of emulator.cc). This might be the most painful part, since this would involve a rocket-chip bump, and those are significantly more involved. Im sure there are other ways to solve this problem, and potentially some use-cases that Im not considering, so Id love to hear what other suggestions you have. Im happy to drive forward progress on resolving this. Thanks",

Current Behavior Hello, I hope this is the right place for my issue but if I should move the discussion to elsewhere feel free to point me to the right place. I am trying to run the MediumBoom Config on the VCU118 FPGA with the fpga-shells support provided in this repository. After adding configs for SmallBoomConfig and MediumBoomConfig to chipyardfpgasrcmainscalavcu118Configs.scala I successfully created bitstreams for both versions. The SmallBoom bitstream boots Linux as expected without any issues. However, MediumBoom interrupts the boot process and seems to hang. I tried simulating the booting with vcs and it shows the same behavior (see attached br-base-no-disk.log). So it seems to me as if this is not necessarily an fpga specific issue. Running the simulation in debug mode shows a WFI uop at ROB head but I was not able to track down the cause (yet). Whats very confusing to me: when running the flow earlier this year on the zcu104 the MediumBoom proceeded to boot but threw a lot of segmentation faults because of what I thought were timing closure congestion issues because of high CLB usage (see mailinglist(https:groups.google.comgchipyardcislBKMgalRQmWrDgZaJeBAAJ)). The versiones used back then were: Chipyard version: 4180463d52bc0a6b4c004530601ccdabebf0ab7d BOOM Version: 1ad28828673f2fce7a18f7255facd4705f04a58a but downgrading to those versions did not help with the current issue. I was not able to generate the bitstream exactly at those hashes because the SNAPSHOT versions in the build.sbt throw errors. Does anyone have a working chipyardboom combination that can boot Linux on the vcu118 in the MediumBoom configuration Can somebody reproduceconfirm this issue  Expected Behavior I would expect the MediumBoom configuration to be able to boot Linux.

Then, I changed the bootmodespi_flash in testbench.. so it had to brach here. but this time, the sim stucks on tb line 767 (Waiting for end of computation) and inherintly, there is not any transition on spi sgnals.. EDIT: Sorry, the problem is that I did not know that I should update the boot_code.cde in sim folder after I changed the boot code. So now, I can see the boot process is starting and running till the wait_clock_refrence(). However, the core is stuck here. Because, as far as I see, the wait_for_interrupt() subroutine does not return successfully. I have checked the itc functions and compared them to the old version. But nothing seemed to be changed.

If you now have a look into pad_control.sv, you see that both vectors are generated either by using the pad configuration register 7 or 8 or the gpio configuration register 7 or 8:  assign pad_cfg_o7  (pad_mux_i7  2b01)  gpio_cfg_i7 : pad_cfg_i7; assign pad_cfg_o8  (pad_mux_i8  2b01)  gpio_cfg_i8 : pad_cfg_i8;  Now, what is strange is that for the other gpio registers (direction, input, output) it seems 7 and 8 are mapped to the uart rxtx pins:  assign out_uart_rx_o  (pad_mux_i7   2b00)  1b0 : ((pad_mux_i7   2b01)  gpio_out_i7  : ((pad_mux_i7   2b10)  i2c1_sda_out_i : s_alt3 )); assign out_uart_tx_o  (pad_mux_i8   2b00)  uart_tx_i : ((pad_mux_i8   2b01)  gpio_out_i8  : ((pad_mux_i8   2b10)  i2c1_scl_out_i : s_alt3 ));  But the UART RXTX configurations come from pad_cfg_i33 and pad_cfg34:  pad_functional_pu padinst_uart_rx (.OEN(oe_uart_rx_i ), .I(out_uart_rx_i ), .O(in_uart_rx_o ), .PAD(pad_uart_rx ), .PEN(pad_cfg_i330) ); pad_functional_pu padinst_uart_tx (.OEN(oe_uart_tx_i ), .I(out_uart_tx_i ), .O(in_uart_tx_o ), .PAD(pad_uart_tx ), .PEN(pad_cfg_i340) );  They are based on gpio_cfg_i26 and 27.  assign pad_cfg_o33  (pad_mux_i33  2b01)  gpio_cfg_i26 : pad_cfg_i33; assign pad_cfg_o34  (pad_mux_i34  2b01)  gpio_cfg_i27 : pad_cfg_i34;  That means to configure GPIO mode of UART RXTX I need to set up gpio_out7,8, gpio_dir7,8 but gpio_cfg26,27.
