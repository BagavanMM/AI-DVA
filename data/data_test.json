Maybe 5MHz is there for debugging reasons, but when I tried 20MHz for vc707 there isnt any instabilities, and the boot time is reduced significantly. Im not sure if using high frequency will cause any problem for vcu118, but if it does not, the frequency should really be increased. https:github.comucb-barchipyardblobe51c006077c5c06076f6d06e1ca4b7b5093afdd3fpgasrcmainresourcesvcu118sdbootsd.cL177-L179  Expected Behavior SPI frequency at 20-25MHz  Other Information _No response_",

This causes the first keccak round to block until EDN request returns, even though the SW entropy is immediately available.

Current Behavior Hello, I hope this is the right place for my issue but if I should move the discussion to elsewhere feel free to point me to the right place. I am trying to run the MediumBoom Config on the VCU118 FPGA with the fpga-shells support provided in this repository. After adding configs for SmallBoomConfig and MediumBoomConfig to chipyardfpgasrcmainscalavcu118Configs.scala I successfully created bitstreams for both versions. The SmallBoom bitstream boots Linux as expected without any issues. However, MediumBoom interrupts the boot process and seems to hang. I tried simulating the booting with vcs and it shows the same behavior (see attached br-base-no-disk.log). So it seems to me as if this is not necessarily an fpga specific issue. Running the simulation in debug mode shows a WFI uop at ROB head but I was not able to track down the cause (yet). Whats very confusing to me: when running the flow earlier this year on the zcu104 the MediumBoom proceeded to boot but threw a lot of segmentation faults because of what I thought were timing closure congestion issues because of high CLB usage (see mailinglist(https:groups.google.comgchipyardcislBKMgalRQmWrDgZaJeBAAJ)). The versiones used back then were: Chipyard version: 4180463d52bc0a6b4c004530601ccdabebf0ab7d BOOM Version: 1ad28828673f2fce7a18f7255facd4705f04a58a but downgrading to those versions did not help with the current issue. I was not able to generate the bitstream exactly at those hashes because the SNAPSHOT versions in the build.sbt throw errors. Does anyone have a working chipyardboom combination that can boot Linux on the vcu118 in the MediumBoom configuration Can somebody reproduceconfirm this issue  Expected Behavior I would expect the MediumBoom configuration to be able to boot Linux.

I havent exhaustively checked the differences, but I can see that when ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS1, the SRAMs in top.mems.conf are much narrower. To reproduce:   make -C simsvcs ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS1 verilog ...  mv simsvcsgenerated-src simsvcsgenerated-src.custom-firrtl-pass-enabled  make -C simsvcs verilog ...  cat simsvcsgenerated-srcchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfigchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig.top.mems.conf name cc_dir_ext depth 1024 width 136 ports mrw mask_gran 17 name cc_banks_0_ext depth 16384 width 64 ports rw name data_arrays_0_ext depth 512 width 256 ports mrw mask_gran 8 name tag_array_ext depth 64 width 88 ports mrw mask_gran 22 name tag_array_0_ext depth 64 width 84 ports mrw mask_gran 21 name data_arrays_0_0_ext depth 512 width 128 ports mrw mask_gran 32  cat simsvcsgenerated-src.custom-firrtl-pass-enabledchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfigchipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig.top.mems.conf name cc_dir_0_ext depth 1024 width 17 ports mrw mask_gran 17 name cc_banks_0_ext depth 16384 width 64 ports rw name data_arrays_0_0_ext depth 512 width 8 ports mrw mask_gran 8 name tag_array_0_ext depth 64 width 22 ports mrw mask_gran 22 name tag_array_0_0_ext depth 64 width 21 ports mrw mask_gran 21 name data_arrays_0_0_0_ext depth 512 width 32 ports mrw mask_gran 32  You can see that each SRAM is much narrower (the width field is smaller) for the design where ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS1. It looks like the design instantiates several parallel instances of each SRAM to make up the same design as when ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS is unset. Im not sure if the two designs are functionally identical, but even if they are, using narrower SRAMs could be a problem if users were hoping to use particular foundry SRAMs with wider entries.  Expected Behavior I would expect the ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS1 build to produce the same Verilog for the RocketConfig as when ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS is unset.

    "description": "Hi Eunchan, The small wave snippet shown below is from the start of a SHAKE128 test iteration, where I have just written the CFG CSR to switch from EDN to SW entropy - however, this happens in the middle of the EDN entropy refreshing request from the previously completed hash operation. Screenshot from 2021-05-11 14-13-35(https:user-images.githubusercontent.com16736281117885891-4986a780-b263-11eb-9728-192dfa54b2e9.png) As you can see even though the mode_i detects that the new entropy mode is from SW, the state machine remains in the EDN states. This causes the first keccak round to block until EDN request returns, even though the SW entropy is immediately available. Is there any requirement that entropy mode can only be switched from EDN to SW once a refreshing operation has completed, or is this an issue in the design Thanks, Udi",

Stack Overflow, gitter, etc -- If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce the problem: I use the TileLinktoAHB bus module to convert all AXI bus to AHB and run Gemmini with this configuration. Gemmini outputs correct values but a bug is encountered in the TileLinktoAHB process and noticed this bug that might affect others who are also using this module. What is the current behavior The TileLinktoAHB module ignores the bit mask information and directly outputs whatever is on the a_bits_address. What is the expected behavior The hsize and haddr should be affected by a_bits_mask which contains the bit mask information. TileLinktoAHB module is not taking into account of the bit mask information. From the below waveform graph (top module is from Gemmini, bottom is TileLinktoAHB), the correct behavior should be: hsizehaddr changes according to a_bits_mask  so that only the portion of 8000_c9a0  thats not masked by a_bits_mask is output to haddr . but you can see that TileLinktoAHB is not taking into account of the bit mask information. The scala code that needs to be modified is probably somewhere here : https:github.comchipsalliancerocket-chipblob400f99530790a0e149f4d9b52b7ddbcafd41c653srcmainscalatilelinkToAHB.scalaL153 .
