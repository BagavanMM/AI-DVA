Similarly, EDN keeps waiting for the final ACK of CSRNG.

Words 1 and 2 of the seed (0x21CA8E3F and 0x5BA3DBA1) are not being picked up by CSRNG - they are missing in the `rdata_o` sequence at the bottom. `cmd_len_q` stays at 2 and CSRNG remains in the `SendMOP` state forever.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-10-11 17-35-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20307557/195591306-e9b063f5-bc3d-43a1-9f7e-b17f8ee5ed24.png)\r\n\r\nI've worked out a first hot fix here #15402 but something more robust is needed.

    "title": "[dv] X's in the operands of the pervasively used `DV_CHECK` macros results in an implicit check pass",
    "description": "Our `DV_CHECK_*` macros are defined here:\r\nhttps://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/blob/d19d492fcac39fe201469b3935c9cb11c979d5a9/hw/dv/sv/dv_utils/dv_macros.svh#L85\r\n\r\nThey employ a negative check of the condition to throw an error when the condition is not met. \r\n```systemverilog\r\n  if (!(T_)) begin\r\n    // throw error\r\n  end\r\n```\r\nIf the expression `T_` evaluates to 'x' due to Xs in one of the operands in the expression `T_`, `!(T_)` also evaluates to 'x', which is treated as false. As a result, the `if` condition evaluates to false and the check is considered to have passed, because the error is not thrown. Consider the following scenario:\r\n```systemverilog\r\n  logic [31:0] foo;\r\n  foo = '0;\r\n  foo[0] = 1'bx;\r\n  `DV_CHECK_EQ(foo, '1)\r\n  // Expectation: check should fail because none of the bits of foo are 1. \r\n  // Reality: check passes just because the 0th bit is x. The rest of the bits are 0s. \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, ideally we should have used the case equality macro. However, in practice, we have rampantly used logical equality versions of the `DV_CHECK_*` macros throughout our codebase. Also, DV engineers tend to use the non-case equality version of the check macros when one of the operands is a fixed constant. \r\n\r\nA safer approach is to NOT use a negative check - instead use a positive check with error being thrown in the else clause. \r\n```systemverilog\r\n  if (T_) ; else begin\r\n    // throw error\r\n  end\r\n```\r\nWith this change, `DV_CHECK_EQ(foo, '1)` in the above example throws the error as expected. This makes `DV_CHECK` macros in line with an `assert` statement, because `assert` does a positive check, and throws an error thrown when the expression evaluates to false (i.e. the else clause). i.e., `assert(foo == '1)` throws an error because the expression evaluates to false and it goes into `else` block (in case of a missing else block, the tool throws an error with a generic message). In our assert macros, we specify an else block to print a custom message:\r\nhttps://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/blob/d19d492fcac39fe201469b3935c9cb11c979d5a9/hw/ip/prim/rtl/prim_assert_standard_macros.svh#L10\r\n\r\nWe avoid using `assert` in DV code because it is sensitive to `$assertcontrol` statements.  \r\n\r\nWith this change, the macros will now pessimistically fail when the operand of the expressions contains an unknown bit, forcing the DV engineer to address it first (perhaps a missing reset, or not properly initialized, etc). \r\n\r\nThanks @eunchan for bringing this up!",

    "description": "This seems like a bad idea because \"valid is asserted on the first clock\" is the sort of situation that could trigger a HW bug.\r\n\r\nThis delay (in `dv_base_vseq::dut_init`) dates back to an old commit (6d31a7c). I think I managed to trigger the problem that it's trying to work around last night. We've got a task in the TL host driver called `flush_during_reset()`. When we're in reset, this pops and discards any sequence items that come in. Unfortunately, if a sequence item arrives at the same time as we come out of reset, you can end up in a situation where we kill the thread that was popping and discarding the items at the wrong point, leaving things out of whack and getting a UVM error.\r\n\r\nDo we actually need to discard TL items that arrive when we're in reset? If not, we could flush the queue as we go into reset (or 1ps after, if we're worried) and not have to worry about this synchronisation at all.\r\n\r\n@weicaiyang: I think you've looked at this code last? @sriyerg: Since you might have an opinion about whether this is something we need to worry about.",

    "description": "OTBN has a STATUS register which switches value to \"locked\" if it there has been some sort of fatal error. The malformed writes generated by the `tl_intg_err` test cause such an error.\r\n\r\nThe predictor for the behaviour of the STATUS register lives in `otbn_scoreboard.sv` but this test sequence disables the scoreboard. However, it also runs the `csr_wr` sequence that has its own inbuilt scoreboard, checking the register values it reads against the register values it expects. Since the OTBN scoreboard is disabled, it's not able to fix up the expected register values and... boom!\r\n\r\nProbably the principled way to do this is to change the `en_scb` bit to only configure whether we run the evaluator (rather than the predictor) in the scoreboard. But that's probably a big change. Easier might be to disable register value checking in the parallel `csr_wr` sequence if we've turned off the predictor.\r\n\r\n@weicaiyang: I think this is probably your code?\r\n@sriyerg: Any comments on the general design?

Crucially, `vaddr` is not connected.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only usage of pma_checker's response is to set `s2_pma` when TLB is not ready, which is possible in some cases (e.g. if the type of memory operation is prefetch or fence). It seems to me that prefetches are not handled in DCache right now, and IIRC individual fences are not affected by PMAs? So the `pma_checker` code path is mostly redundant? If that's the case, can we remove them all together? If that's not the case, then this may be a bug.\r\n\r\nThis is found during the effort to convert rocket-chip to chisel3 (#3110), which changed the bi-directional connection semantic to disallowing missing fields in either side of the connection.                                                                                             \r\n",

Am I missing something?\r\n- Should this be reported in the chipyard repo instead (as it is indeed something that comes from its default configurations)?\r\n\r\n**Please tell us about your environment:**\r\n<!--    (examples)\r\n    - version: `git commit hash`\r\n    - OS: `Linux knight 4.4.0-92-generic #115-Ubuntu SMP Thu Aug 10 09:04:33 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`\r\n-->\r\n- version: bf5742b9e353a80f501d43130218d3a444ec4b30\r\n- OS: `Linux alf-xps 5.4.0-100-generic #113~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 7 15:02:59 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`\r\n\r\n**What is the use case for changing the behavior?**\r\nN/A",

Gemmini outputs correct values but a bug is encountered in the TileLinktoAHB process and noticed this bug that might affect others who are also using this module.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe TileLinktoAHB module ignores the bit mask information and directly outputs whatever is on the `a_bits_address`.\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe hsize and haddr should be affected by a_bits_mask which contains the bit mask information.\r\n\r\n\r\nTileLinktoAHB module is not taking into account of the bit mask information. From the below waveform graph (top module is from Gemmini, bottom is TileLinktoAHB), the correct behavior should be: `hsize`/`haddr `changes according to `a_bits_mask `  so that only the portion of `8000_c9a0 ` that's not masked by  `a_bits_mask` is output to `haddr `. but you can see that TileLinktoAHB is not taking into account of the bit mask information.

Effectively, it must be paired with a `TLFIFOFixer`, or it can generate illegal TileLink transactions (multiple outstanding transactions with the same source ID), and also return illegally-ordered AXI4 responses. This is a performance issue (only allowing one in-flight transaction severely limits AXI4 bandwidth, especially when paired with a high-latency TileLink memory system), and then turns into a logic bug when trying to fix the performance issue.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRight now, we depend on pairing an `AXI4ToTL` widget with an `AXI4UserYanker` to define the `maxFlight` parameter in `AXI4ToTL`. This defines the maximum supported in-flight transactions for each AXI ID.\r\n\r\nThe \"Operation Ordering\" section of the TileLink spec says:\r\n\r\n> Within a TileLink network, there may be multiple outstanding operations inflight at any given time. These operations may be completed in any order.\r\n\r\nSection 5.1 of the AXI4 spec says:\r\n\r\n> All transactions with a given AXI ID value must remain ordered, but there is no restriction on the ordering of transactions with different ID values.\r\n\r\nThese semantics are different between TileLink and AXI4, in particular AXI4 has special ordering restrictions within a single AXI ID. When `maxFlight` is set to 1, there are no ordering issues, since each AXI ID can only have a single transaction in flight at once, and there are no ordering constraints between transactions with different AXI IDs. In this case, the AXI4 ordering model matches TileLink's ordering model. However, once `maxFlight` exceeds 1, the AXI network depends on `AXI4ToTL` to maintain ordering of transactions within the same AXI ID, which is not the current behavior.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior (read requests)\r\n\r\nLooking at the example of read requests, this is the logic `AXI4ToTL` uses to generate multiple TileLink requests for AXI requests on a single AXI ID:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval r_count = RegInit(Vec.fill(numIds) { UInt(0, width = txnCountBits) })\r\nval r_id = if (maxFlight == 1) {\r\n  Cat(in.ar.bits.id, UInt(0, width=1))\r\n} else {\r\n  Cat(in.ar.bits.id, r_count(in.ar.bits.id)(logFlight-1,0), UInt(0, width=1))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, `r_count` is a vector of counters, one counter for each supported AXI ID. Here's the code for how those counters are incremented:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval r_sel = UIntToOH(in.ar.bits.id, numIds)\r\n(r_sel.asBools zip r_count) foreach { case (s, r) =>\r\n  when (in.ar.fire() && s) { r := r + UInt(1) }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs expected, whenever a request is sent, we increment the appropriate counter based on the AXI ID the request came from.\r\n\r\nTo see the problem with this scheme, think of this setup: we support only 1 AXI ID (so `numIds` is 1), and we support two transactions in flight for this AXI ID (so `maxFlight` is 2). We receive two AXI read requests from this single AXI ID, back-to-back, and `AXI4ToTL` will happily issue two TileLink Get requests back-to-back, each with unique `r_id`s, since `r_count` is incremented after the first request. After sending the second request, `r_count` is incremented a second time, which means `r_id` returns to the original value used for the first TileLink Get request. Now, if the two responses come back out-of-order (maybe request 1 is a cache miss and request 2 is a cache hit), and there's another AXI request waiting to be sent, then when we send request 3, we'll re-use the same TileLink source identifier from request 1, which is still in flight. This is illegal, since all outstanding TileLink requests must be uniquely identifiable by their source IDs.\r\n\r\nSo that's one problem with this system: we re-use TileLink source IDs when responses come back out-of-order, and this leads to the TileLink Monitors triggering assertions. There's one more problem though: let's assume we fixed AXI4ToTL so that it would only issue TileLink requests with valid source IDs when an out-of-order response came back. This response is still invalid from the AXI4 master's perspective, because it expects all of its requests from a single AXI ID to turn into well-ordered responses. Thus, AXI4ToTL would need re-ordering logic for all outstanding read requests within a single AXI ID to convert the out-of-order TileLink read responses into in-order AXI read responses.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior (write requests)\r\n\r\nThe write request logic in `AXI4ToTL` is the same as the read request logic, so it will encounter the same TileLink-source-reuse bug as described above. However, I don't believe the other logical bug (relative ordering of transactions within a single AXI ID) will be an issue. This is what the AXI4 specification has to say about write transaction ordering within an AXI ID:\r\n\r\n> The data transfers for a sequence of write transactions with the same AWID value must complete in the order in which the master issued the addresses\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what restrictions this will place on how we issue TileLink Put requests, or how we re-order (or don't re-order) AXI4 write responses. Do we have to re-order AXI4 write responses in case write requests complete out-of-order? Do we need to ensure the TileLink interconnect will reflect those TileLink Put requests in-order? I'm not sure what the correct behavior is for this case, I've mostly put my time into thinking about the read-request scenario.\r\n\r\n#### How to replicate\r\n\r\nIt looks like most use-cases for `AXI4ToTL` implicitly use the `TLFIFOFixer`, so this isn't a logical issue. However, I'll give an example of replicating this for the NVDLA. [`Periphery.scala` for the NVDLA](https://github.com/ucb-bar/nvdla-wrapper/blob/412da40b054238126856049a3530e397902a925d/src/main/scala/devices/nvdla/Periphery.scala#L17) uses the [`fromMaster` method](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/00d9e02c1901d0285f22eefec7c25073fb90e4f1/src/main/scala/tilelink/BusWrapper.scala#L328-L335) to connect to the `fbus`, which implicitly inserts a `TLFIFOFixer`. If you instead use [`coupleFrom`](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/00d9e02c1901d0285f22eefec7c25073fb90e4f1/src/main/scala/tilelink/BusWrapper.scala#L90-L91), then the `TLFIFOFixer` will disappear. Running an NVDLA workload will reveal this logical bug.\r\n\r\n#### Ideas for resolution\r\n\r\nSome of this is addressed in the previously-linked Chipyard Google Group discussion, but here's the summary:\r\n\r\n- I've implemented a straightforward design which has a number of limitations (doesn't support multi-beat AXI4 bursts, read-response-reordering space scales poorly with outstanding transactions and AXI4 IDs).\r\n- @zhemao gave some great ideas on how to improve the space scaling issues, and I've mostly implemented that design.\r\n- I'm unsure of how to resolve the inevitable space-scaling issues when supporting multi-beat bursts. Perhaps this is inevitable, but maybe we should give users the option to restrict the max AXI4 burst length (there's a mechanism for this for TileLink, but not really for AXI4).\r\n\r\n**Please tell us about your environment:**\r\n- Chipyard release 1.3\r\n- Ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n**What is the use case for changing the behavior?**\r\n\r\nImproved AXI4 performance",

taken / Documentation Followed / etc...\nI followed [1.4. Initial Repository Setup](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html#initial-repository-setup) setup chipyard. Then I tried [2.1. Software RTL Simulation](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Simulation/Software-RTL-Simulation.html#software-rtl-simulation) and [5.7. ASAP7 Tutorial](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/VLSI/ASAP7-Tutorial.html#asap7-tutorial). Then I did `make clean` in `chipyard/vlsi` dir.\nI followed [5.9. Sky130 + OpenROAD Tutorial](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/VLSI/Sky130-OpenROAD-Tutorial.html) to install Sky130 and OpenROAD dependencies:\n```bash\n# channel settings so openroad/klayout install properly\nconda config --set channel_priority true\nconda config --add channels defaults\n\n# download all files for Sky130A PDK\nconda create -c litex-hub --prefix ~/.conda-sky130

strict\nconda config --remove channels defaults\n```\n\nBefore I ran, I executed: \n```bash\nsource env.sh\n./scripts/init-vlsi.sh sky130 openroad\ncd vlsi\n```\n\nI alse filled `example-sky130.yml` and `example-openroad.yml`.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen I ran `make buildfile tutorial=sky130-openroad`, I got the following error:\n\n```text\n[<global>] Loading hammer-vlsi libraries and reading

The Gemmini submodule is at commit f13847e8.\n\nIssue Description:\n\nThe standard tiled_matmul_ws-baremetal test completes successfully. However, when I run tests that include more complex operations like softmax or layernorm, the simulation consistently fails with an assertion error in ReservationStation.scala.\n\nEnvironment:\n\n    OS: Ubuntu 22.04\n\n    Chipyard Version: 1.10.0\n\n    Gemmini Commit Hash: f13847e8\n\nCommands to Reproduce:\n\n1. Successful Command:\ncode Bash\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\n    \nmake CONFIG=GemminiRocketConfig run-binary BINARY=../../generators/gemmini/software/gemmini-rocc-tests/build/bareMetalC/tiled_matmul_ws-baremetal\n\n  \n\n2. Failing Command (e.g., with softmax):\ncode Bash\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\n    \nmake CONFIG=GemminiRocketConfig run-binary BINARY=../../generators/gemmini/software/gemmini-rocc-tests/build/bareMetalC/tiled_matmul_ws_softmax-baremetal\n\n  \n\nAssertion Failure Log:\n\nThe failing simulation produces the following error, indicating an invalid entry is being accessed in the reservation station:\ncode Code\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\n    \nError: \"/home/mingzhenjia/Desktop/chipyard/sims/vcs/generated-src/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.GemminiRocketConfig/gen-collateral/ReservationStation.sv\", 9827: TestDriver.testHarness.chiptop0.system.tile_prci_domain.tile_reset_domain_tile.gemmini.reservation_station: at time 2877727000 ps\nAssertion failed\n    at ReservationStation.scala:479 assert(entries_st(issue_id).valid)\n\nFatal: \"/home/mingzhenjia/Desktop/chipyard/sims/vcs/generated-src/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.GemminiRocketConfig/gen-collateral/ReservationStation.sv\", 9829: TestDriver.testHarness.chiptop0.system.tile_prci_domain.tile_reset_domain_tile.gemmini.reservation_station: at time 2877727000 ps\n$finish called from file \"/home/mingzhenjia/Desktop/chipyard/sims/vcs/generated-src/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.GemminiRocketConfig/gen-collateral/ReservationStation.sv\", line 9829.\n\n  \n\nFor reference, the log from the successful run (tiled_matmul_ws-baremetal.log) completes as expected:\ncode Code\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\n    \n...\nStarting gemmini matmul\nCycles taken: 2392\nStarting slow CPU matmul\nCycles taken: 3227174\nFatal: \".../TestDriver.v\", 147: TestDriver: at time 10000000500 ps\n$finish called from file \".../TestDriver.v\", line 147.\n\n  \n\nMy Analysis:\n\nThe assertion assert(entries_st(issue_id).valid) suggests that the reservation station is receiving an instruction to issue an entry that is not valid. Since this only occurs for workloads with softmax/layernorm, it seems related to how these specific micro-operations are scheduled or tracked within Gemmini's pipeline.\n\nCould someone please provide insight into what might be causing this assertion failure? I would also appreciate any recommendations for further debugging steps, such as specific signals to trace or configuration changes to try.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should print cycles.\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

THe problem is that the linux is not booting. \n```\nINIT\nCMD0\nsd_cmd: timeout\nERROR\n```\n\n<img width=\"810\" height=\"777\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6da537aa-0276-4c91-b731-c279ab7ad9b5\" />\n\nI am using Digilent PMOD microSD card module and the microSD is built using the standard flow provided here:\nhttps://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Prototyping/VCU118.html \nI also read through the following issues:\n#1785  #1059 #957\n\nIn order to debug the system, I added the JTAG using this PR #1796 and configured the settings to use PMOD J53 for JTAG debug. Now that it is added, I tried to connect to it using Digilent HS2 Debug adapter https://digilent.com/shop/jtag-hs2-programming-cable/?srsltid=AfmBOoofb16xUPK6I19R6T1wS0hIlqSH5fa1QSKZQ-FcmgUmfnVtNi-E. Some parts of my openocd config can be seen below:\n```\n# Digilent HS2 with RISC-V target configuration\n# Fixes JTAG connectivity errors - Rev 1.2\n\n# ----------------- ADAPTER CONFIGURATION -----------------\nadapter driver ftdi\nftdi_vid_pid 0x0403 0x6014 \nftdi_channel 0\nftdi_layout_init 0x00e8 0x60eb  \n\n# Reduce JTAG speed for stability (adjust as needed)\nadapter speed 500\n\n# ----------------- JTAG SCAN CHAIN SETUP -----------------\ntransport select jtag\n\n# RISC-V TAP configuration (generic parameters)\njtag newtap riscv cpu -irlen 5 -ircapture 0x01 -irmask 0x0f\n\n# ----------------- TARGET SETUP -----------------\ntarget create riscv.cpu riscv -chain-position riscv.cpu\nriscv set_reset_timeout_sec 1000\nriscv set_command_timeout_sec 3000\n\n# Workaround for connection issues\nriscv use_bscan_tunnel 0\n\n# ----------------- INITIALIZATION -----------------\n# Reset handling\nreset_config srst_only\nreset_config srst_push_pull\n\n# Initialization sequence\ninit\ntargets riscv.cpu\n\nputs \"Configuration loaded - JTAG ready\"\nputs \"Connect with GDB on port 3333\"\n```\n\nHowever, I get the following issues:\n\n<img width=\"798\" height=\"389\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26092d3f-a2c2-4c54-9bbb-24b3b72fc500\" />\n\nI found out that the config defaults to JTAG on FMC_J2  \nhttps://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip-fpga-shells/blob/17bd8d286297468a0256b15f908be08396cf804e/src/main/scala/shell/xilinx/VCU118NewShell.scala#L483\ntherefore I tried to use FMC_J2 for JTAG using an FMC adapter card from Xilinx\nhttps://www.amd.com/en/products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/board-accessories/hw-fmc-xm105-g.html\nbut still without luck.\nI am open to suggestions or pointers.

Bitstream is built and flashed successfully, workload is also built and installed successfully. However, cannot get past `[    0.004647] smp: Bringing up secondary CPUs ...`. Simulation directory shows `heartbeat.csv` continues to record data.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSimulation should not hang on boot, as in the case of the single-core Shuttle configuration. User should be prompted with buildroot login and have access to the simulated instance's terminal interface.\n\n\n### Other Information\n\n## Verilator Test\n\nPrior to running FireSim, dual-core Shuttle configuration (MyDualShuttleConfig) was simulated in Verilator using baremetal workload `${CY_DIR}/tests/hello.c` as shown below. Program completes successfully (see attached `hello.log` and `hello.out`).\n\t\n``` bash\ncd ${CY_DIR}/tests\n/usr/local/bin/cmake -S ./ -B ./build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\n/usr/local/bin/cmake --build ./build/ --target hello\ncd ../sims/verilator\nmake run-binary SUB_PROJECT=dualshuttle BINARY=../../tests/build/hello.riscv\n```\n\nFor reference, `${CY_DIR}/variables.mk` was modified to include the following\n\n``` make\nifeq ($(SUB_PROJECT),dualshuttle)\n\tSBT_PROJECT       ?= chipyard\n\tMODEL             ?= TestHarness\n\tVLOG_MODEL        ?= $(MODEL)\n\tMODEL_PACKAGE     ?= chipyard.harness\n\tCONFIG            ?= MyDualShuttleConfig\n\tCONFIG_PACKAGE    ?= $(SBT_PROJECT)\n\tGENERATOR_PACKAGE ?= $(SBT_PROJECT)\n\tTB                ?= TestDriver\n\tTOP               ?= ChipTop\nendif\n```\n\nThen, `${CY_DIR}/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/config/ShuttleConfigs.scala` was modified to include the following\n\n``` scala\nclass MyDualShuttleConfig extends Config(\n  new shuttle.common.WithNShuttleCores(2) ++\n  new chipyard.config.AbstractConfig)\n```\n\n## FireSim Test\n\nTo simulate the configuration using FireSim (local VCU118), `${CY_DIR}/generators/firechip/chip/src/main/scala/TargetConfigs.scala` was modified to include the following:\n\n``` scala\nclass FireSimMyDualShuttleConfig extends Config(\n  new WithDefaultFireSimBridges ++\n  new WithFireSimConfigTweaks ++\n  new chipyard.MyDualShuttleConfig)\n\nclass FireSimMyDualShuttle4GiBDRAMConfig extends Config(\n  new freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.WithExtMemSize((1 << 30) * 4L) ++\n  new FireSimMyDualShuttleConfig)\n```\n\nA bitstream was built for this configuration by modifying `${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_build_recipes.yaml` to include the following target\n\n``` yaml\nxilinx_vcu118_firesim_shuttle_dualcore_4GB_no_nic:\n\tPLATFORM: xilinx_vcu118\n\tTARGET_PROJECT: firesim\n\tTARGET_PROJECT_MAKEFRAG: ../../generators/firechip/chip/src/main/makefrag/firesim\n\tDESIGN: FireSim\n\tTARGET_CONFIG: FireSimMyDualShuttle4GiBDRAMConfig\n\tPLATFORM_CONFIG: BaseXilinxVCU118Config\n\tdeploy_quintuplet: null\n\tplatform_config_args:\n\t    fpga_frequency: 50\n\t    build_strategy: TIMING\n\tpost_build_hook: null\n\tmetasim_customruntimeconfig: null\n\tbit_builder_recipe: bit-builder-recipes/xilinx_vcu118.yaml\n```\n\nThe target was used to set `builds_to_run` in `${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim/deploy/config_build.yaml`. The build completed successfully (see attached `buildbitstream.log`)\n\nThe appropriate entry was placed in `${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_hwdb.yaml` for `xilinx_vcu118_firesim_shuttle_dualcore_4GB_no_nic` with the path for `bitstream_tar`. Then, the `br-base` buildroot workload was built and installed using FireMarshal as shown below. The operations completed successfully (see attached `br-base-build.log` and `br-base-install.log`)\n\n``` bash\ncd ${CY_DIR}/software/firemarshal\n./marshal -v build br-base.json\n./marshal -v install br-base.json\n```\n\nThe bitstream was flashed onto the VCU118 and the workload was run as shown below (see attached infrasetup.log and runworkload.log).\n\n``` bash\nfiresim infrasetup -a ${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_hwdb.yaml -r ${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_build_recipes.yaml\nfiresim runworkload -a ${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_hwdb.yaml -r ${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_build_recipes.yaml\n```\n\nThe simulation outputs are also attached (see `uartlog`, `heartbeat.csv`, and `memory_stats0.csv`). Also, see attached photos (`photo_1.png` and `photo_2.png`).\n\nFor reference, the default ShuttleConfig (single-core) does not face this issue (OS stuck on boot during FireSim simulation with VCU118).\n\n\n[shuttle_bug_report.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20822354/shuttle_bug_report.zip)",

This C program includes a 2 - D array sized at [6][4096].\n   I used 6 ROCC instructions to transfer the elements in this array, moving one row at a time (meaning one ROCC instruction could transfer 4096 elements). But when I performed the run - binary - debug operation on the compiled program, Chipyard reported the following error.\uff08By the way,the The array type is long long.\uff09\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nError: \"/home/worker/code/chipyard-1.13.0/sims/vcs/generated-src/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.RoccExamRocketConfig/gen-collateral/TestHarness.sv\", 99: TestDriver.testHarness: at time 767415000 ps\nAssertion failed: *** FAILED *** (exit code =          5)\n\n    at SimTSI.scala:21 assert(!error, \"*** FAILED *** (exit code = %%d)\\n\", exit >> 1.U)\n\nFatal: \"/home/worker/code/chipyard-1.13.0/sims/vcs/generated-src/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.RoccExamRocketConfig/gen-collateral/TestHarness.sv\", 101: TestDriver.testHarness: at time 767415000 ps\n$finish called from file \"/home/worker/code/chipyard-1.13.0/sims/vcs/generated-src/chipyard.harness.TestHarness.RoccExamRocketConfig/gen-collateral/TestHarness.sv\", line 101.\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nStrangely, the error disappears and data transfer works normally when I reduce the array size to [5][4096] (removing one row of elements) and use 5 ROCC instructions.\nI wonder if the issue is due to my .riscv file being too large, as it has reached 233KB. If not, what could be causing this? I hope to get your help.\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nData transfer with ROCC instructions can function normally even when the array size is [6][4096].\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

Documentation Followed / etc...\r\n\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nI have ported  a NVDLA testcase to C and try to run it on RocketChip+NVDLA large FPGA.\r\nAt the stage of init, the  testcase program write predifined  feature and  weight data to dedicate ddr(Cacheable) space,  0xC000B800(size 0x8000)  and 0xC0002700(size 0x9000)\uff0cand then the program setup some NV REGS and run.\r\nI find that NVDLA can not read the mentioned data correctly(even different between test case runs).And the result output is error because of this bug.\r\n\r\nThen I tried  to flush the cache  before set  NVDLA REG to go, the result is correctly.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNVDLA  read the data in  cache correctly.\n\n### Other Information\n\nHere is the 'pseudo' code from NVDLA site

Documentation Followed / etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nI am developing a custom MMIO device and testing it on chipyard using Verilator. In the custom MMIO device that am developing, I dependent on a Blackbox (System Verilog) for some parts of module. \r\n I am running normally:\r\n\"make run-binary-debug LOADMEM=1 BINARY=myBinary.riscv CONFIG=MyCustomConfig\"\r\n\r\nAfter doing all the intensive tests on my module, I tried to run:\r\n\"make run-binary LOADMEM=1 BINARY=myBinary.riscv CONFIG=MyCustomConfig\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly my module is not working correctly anymore!\r\n\r\nI am not sure what changes between the two builds, but as I understood debug should only extra generate a vcd file for the waveforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI am expecting make-binary and make-binary-debug to act the same!\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Currently, it seems that the iobinder for `HasPeripheryDebug` punched out only JTAGChipIO(4 wires) out of chip. After going thru the code, it seems that the `ndreset `are left unconnected, this means that the debugger can not write `ndmreset` field of `dmcontrol` to reset the whole system(except the `DTM` AND `DM`),  also the `system.resetctrl.hartResetReq` seems also unconnected, indicating that we can not reset the specific hart by asserting `hartreset` in `dmcontrol`. So, If we leave the iobinder as it currently is, does this mean that there is no way for debuggers to forcefully reset the whole system or a speicific hart.  Since this is our first tapout, I wonder if this is the default debugging configuration for other team that had tapped out chipyard based design before. \r\nCan anyone shed some light into this? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks for you work.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSee above\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

    "description": "### Background Work\n\n- [X] Yes, I searched the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chipyard)\n- [X] Yes, I searched [prior issues](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/issues)\n- [X] Yes, I searched the [documentation](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/)\n\n### Chipyard Version and Hash\n\nmain\n\n### OS Setup\n\nLinux pc 6.2.0-37-generic #38~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\n\n### Other Setup\n\nI'm trying to add support cosim for CVA6. So I add a new config like this:\r\n```scala\r\nclass CVA6CosimConfig extends Config(\r\n  new chipyard.harness.WithCospike ++                   // attach spike-cosim\r\n  new chipyard.config.WithTraceIO ++                    // enable the traceio\r\n  new cva6.WithNCVA6Cores(1) ++\r\n  new chipyard.config.AbstractConfig)\r\n```\r\nThen do `make CONFIG=CVA6CosimConfig` in `sims/verilator`. The object is generated successfully. However, when I try to cosim a elf file like this: `./simulator-chipyard.harness-CVA6CosimConfig $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/share/riscv-tests/isa/rv64ui-p-simple`.\r\n\r\nThe cosim return an error about mismatch on writing register. I check the CVA6 top file. It seems that the trace from CVA6 does not contain wdata signal. And `chipyard` also sets [traceHasWdata](https://github.com/ucb-bar/cva6-wrapper/blob/a2584610225ab296c4fb77a66f70eec64908efd0/src/main/scala/cva6/CVA6Tile.scala#L79) to be false.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Current Behavior\n\ncosim report a mismatch on registers. However, the wdata is not valid `has_wdata = false`.\r\n\r\nAnd `has_wdata` is unused in function [cospike_cosim](https://github.com/ucb-bar/testchipip/blob/c94c1e3fa9f7437a3e95f63181cf0f54b8650b3a/src/main/resources/testchipip/csrc/cospike_impl.cc#L158)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n[cospike_cosim](https://github.com/ucb-bar/testchipip/blob/c94c1e3fa9f7437a3e95f63181cf0f54b8650b3a/src/main/resources/testchipip/csrc/cospike_impl.cc#L158) should not check wdata when `has_wata` is false.\n\n### Other Information\n\nIf I just remove the check for wdata, the cosim for CVA6 also fails.\r\nNow I don't know how to solve this problem, am I missing some features of CVA6? Can you give me some advice on CVA6 cosim?\r\n```\r\nCosim: Configuring spike cosim\r\nCosim: isa string: rv64imafdczicsr_zifencei_zihpm_zicntr\r\nCosim: priv: MSU\r\nCosim: pmpregions: 8\r\nCosim: harts: 1\r\nCosim: htif args: /home/lzz/hAPR/chipyard/.conda-env/riscv-tools/riscv64-unknown-elf/share/riscv-tests/isa/rv64ui-p-simple\r\nCosim: Matching spike memory initial state for region 80000000-90000000\r\nCosim: Setting up htif\r\nCosim: Started\r\nCosim: Tohost addr   : 80001000\r\nCosim: Fromhost addr : 80001040\r\nCosim: BootROM base  : 10000\r\nCosim: BootROM size  : 10000\r\nCosim: Memory0 base  : 80000000\r\nCosim: Memory0 size  : 10000000\r\nCosim: Memory1 base  : 0\r\nCosim: Memory1 size  : 0\r\nCosim: Memory2 base  : 0\r\nCosim: Memory2 size  : 0\r\nCosim: 271 commit: 10000\r\ncore   0: 3 0x0000000000010000 (0x00000517) x10 0x0000000000010000\r\nCosim: 10f wdata mismatch reg 10 10000 != 0\r\nCosim: 281 commit: 10004\r\ncore   0: 3 0x0000000000010004 (0x04050513) x10 0x0000000000010040\r\nCosim: 119 wdata mismatch reg 10 10040 != 0\r\nCosim: 291 commit: 10008\r\ncore   0: 3 0x0000000000010008 (0x30551073) c773_mtvec 0x0000000000010040\r\nCosim: 301 commit: 1000c\r\ncore   0: 3 0x000000000001000c (0x301022f3) x5  0x800000000014112d\r\nCosim: CSR read 301\r\nCosim: CSR override: old=800000000014112d new=0\r\nCosim: 311 commit: 10010\r\ncore   0: 3 0x0000000000010010 (0x4122d293) x5  0x0000000000000000\r\nCosim: 321 commit: 10014\r\ncore   0: 3 0x0000000000010014 (0x0012f293) x5  0x0000000000000000\r\nCosim: 331 commit: 10018\r\ncore   0: 3 0x0000000000010018 (0x00028863)\r\nCosim: 341 commit: 1001c\r\ncore   0: 3 0x0000000000010028 (0x00800513) x10 0x0000000000000008\r\nCosim: 341 PC mismatch spike 10028 != DUT 1001c\r\n```",

If binding\r\n  //       a PLIC to the CBUS, ensure it is synchronously coupled to the SBUS.\r\n  ibus.clockNode := viewpointBus.fixedClockNode\r\n\r\n```\r\nConsequently, when the interrupts goes to plic from ibus, there may be a cross domain issue right? So, I think the ToPLIC should be as follows:\r\n`def toPLIC(xing: ClockCrossingType = NoCrossing): IntOutwardNode = to(Some(\"toPLIC\"))(xing)`\r\nI maybe wrong about this, can anyone in the team shed some light into this ?\r\nThanks!\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n*\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

Setup\n\nEx: Prior steps taken / Documentation Followed / etc...\r\nAfter a fresh setup with that commit, follow https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html\r\n\r\nThen https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/VLSI/Sky130-OpenROAD-Tutorial.html\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen pulling a fresh repo, doing the setup, then following the steps in this tutorial https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/VLSI/Sky130-OpenROAD-Tutorial.html, I am getting an issue where during the placement stage, the amount of memory that is used increases without bound. All 200 GB of swap memory in my Ubuntu setup gets consumed, then ubuntu kills openroad. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMemory will stay within a reasonable range during the place stage. \n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

test program reads addresses at 0x3008, 0x3010, etc. which are mapped to my device (TLUserFieldReader). Then, the device simply read the user field (MyUserField) and put it to the data field of the response. \r\nIn DCache where the read request is created, lower one byte of target address is stored in the user field.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I expected for the program to print 0x8 and 0x10 but the current results are both 0x0.\r\n\r\n# Test Result\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n[UART] UART0 is here (stdin/stdout).\r\nStart TLUserField Test...\r\nRead 0x30008, result: 0x0\r\nRead 0x30010, result: 0x00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the current behavior section.\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nI debugged my self and figure out the reason. In Xbar (Xbar.scala), user fields of in and out are not connected even if there are custom user field.\r\nMy suggestion is that Xbar connects user field if there are list of the custom user field.\r\nI've attached the patch that I'd like to contribute.\r\n\r\nPlease review my bug report and solution. \r\nIf you like my device (TLUserFieldReader) and related codes, it would good to be part of chipyard examples.\r\n\r\nThere might be misunderstanding something about this issue.

The RISC-V toolchain and tools have been installed from Homebrew:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Formulae\r\nriscv-software-src/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain \u2714\r\nriscv-software-src/riscv/riscv-isa-sim \u2714\r\nriscv-software-src/riscv/riscv-openocd \u2714\r\nriscv-software-src/riscv/riscv-pk \u2714\r\nriscv-software-src/riscv/riscv-tools \u2714\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am using `Verilator 5.024 2024-04-05 rev UNKNOWN.REV` albeit with a slight hack to get around [Issue 5031](https://github.com/verilator/verilator/pull/5031) - yes, it is currently troublesome to get verilator working under the latest Sonoma and Clang updates on MacOS \ud83d\ude12.\r\n\r\n### Other Setup\r\n\r\n**Step 0**: Install RISC-V tools via Homebrew (see OS Setup section). Also, install _gnu-sed_, _jq_ and _help2man_. Possible other packages that escape me now ...\r\n\r\n**Step 1**: Setting up environment variables. I am using my own handwritten script here due to installing RISC-V tools and toolchain from Homebrew and using a custom-compiled verilator.\r\n```bash\r\n# Avoids issues due to different options for sed on MacOS.\r\n# Requires gnu-sed to be installed via homebrew.\r\nexport PATH=\"/opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\"\r\n\r\n# Use RISC-V toolchain installed via homebrew.\r\n# Requires riscv-gnu-toolchain to be installed via homebrew.\r\nexport RISCV=\"/opt/homebrew/opt/riscv-gnu-toolchain/bin\"\r\n\r\n# Sets additional include paths\r\nexport CPPFLAGS=\"-I/opt/homebrew/opt/riscv-isa-sim/include\"\r\n\r\n# Need to link verilator simulation executable.\r\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L/opt/homebrew/opt/riscv-isa-sim/lib\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Step 2*: Patch `common-sim-flags.mk` by removing `-std=c++17` from `SIM_CXXFLAGS`. Long story short, we need  to compile verilator code with `-std=c++20` in order to circumvent [Issue 5031](https://github.com/verilator/verilator/pull/5031) . My patched verilator does that, but this is for a different issue.\r\n\r\n*Step 3*: Enter `sims/verilator` and run `make`.\r\n```\r\ncd sims/verilators\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Step 4*: Run the verilator simulation executable. I.e.,\r\n```\r\n./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig rv64ui-p-simple`\r\n```\r\nassuming that rv64ui-p-simple (from [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests) is located in the current directory.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nOn my system, this results in an immediate *Segmentation Fault*.\r\n```\r\n./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig $RISCV_TESTS/rv64ui-p-simple\r\n[UART] UART0 is here (stdin/stdout).\r\nzsh: segmentation fault  ./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig $RISCV_TESTS/rv64ui-p-simple\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttached is a relevant extract from the MacOS Diagnostic report.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/assets/7477102/54f16179-adf2-4f31-a816-91f578a028e6)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPerform simulation and do not crash.\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nI have already debugged and somewhat fixed the issue. The culprit, as can be seen from the stack trace, is\r\n```\r\ngenerators/src/main/resources/testchipip/csrc/SimTSI.cc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code:\r\n```c\r\n  *in_valid = tsi->in_valid();\r\n  *in_bits = tsi->in_bits();\r\n  *out_ready = tsi->out_ready();\r\n```\r\n(see https://github.com/ucb-bar/testchipip/blob/104df6a81fd989cd4cad69b699894664fcf93c05/src/main/resources/testchipip/csrc/SimTSI.cc#L59-L61) is unsafe. `tsi->in_bits();` implicitly calls the `std::queue::front()` method/function whose behavior is **undefined** if the queue is empty. Hence, replace the above, for instance, by\r\n```c\r\n  *in_valid = tsi->in_valid();\r\n  *in_bits = *in_valid ? tsi->in_bits() : 0;\r\n  *out_ready = tsi->out_ready();\r\n```\r\nto avoid the crash. (The above code is not thread-safe though, perhaps it does not need to be ...)\r\n\r\n**Note**: I have not tried if this is an issue under Ubuntu/Linux. My suspicion is that there, the program would just continue with some arbitrary value for `*in_bits`. Semantically, anything can happen once we enter undefined behavior, so the above fix is advised either way!\r\n\r\nPS: I apologize for just realizing that this bug report may have been better submitted in the [testchipip](https://github.com/ucb-bar/testchipip) repository.",

extends Config(\r\n  new chipyard.harness.WithSimNetwork ++\r\n  new icenet.WithIceNIC ++\r\n  new freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.WithNBigCores(1) ++\r\n  new chipyard.config.AbstractConfig)\r\n```\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen I run: `make -C sims/verilator CONFIG=TapNICRocketConfig VERILATOR_THREADS=1` with any number of threads larger than `1`, I end up with a simulator program that dies with a SIGSEGV almost as soon as I can launch it.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence (and, to address what I'm _really_ after), running the `pingd.c` test results in a ~2s ping on my system. That's longer than the default interval of a second, which means that running `ping` with no arguments against the single-threaded RTL simulation is an effective DOS strategy as it sends ICMP echo requests at about 2x the throughput the simulator can maintain.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSimply, I expected to be able to \"throw more threads at it,\" as most of the time seems to be going to front-end stalls due to icache misses, something that multiple threads addresses nicely by way of expanding the effective available icache space.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, I suppose I expected there to be a way to get to workable performance of the RTL model for functional simulation of simple network nodes without custom hardware, proprietary software, or an FPGA-equipped cloud instance. Perhaps my expectation that such a path exists through `verilator` is worth discussing here, too?\n\n### Other Information\n\n`coredumpctl debug`  suggests this is because the thread-local context_t isn't fully initialized in all threads:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCore was generated by `/home/seth/Code/src/github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/sims/verilator/simulator-chipya'.\r\nProgram terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\r\n#0  0x000056067f92ac60 in context_t::switch_to (this=0x56068194f370) at ../fesvr/context.cc:86\r\n86        cur = this;\r\n[Current thread is 1 (Thread 0x7fece98bb6c0 (LWP 4017918))]\r\n(gdb) bt\r\n#0  0x000056067f92ac60 in context_t::switch_to (this=0x56068194f370) at ../fesvr/context.cc:86\r\n#1  0x000056067f3dda89 in network_tick ()\r\n#2  0x000056067f555b96 in VTestDriver___024unit____Vdpiimwrap_network_tick_TOP____024unit(unsigned char, unsigned long, unsigned char, unsigned char&, unsigned long&, unsigned char&, unsigned long&) ()\r\n#3  0x000056067f739e90 in VTestDriver___024root___nba_sequent__TOP__1899(VTestDriver___024root*) ()\r\n#4  0x000056067f44d8b6 in VTestDriver___024root____Vthread__nba__2(void*, bool) ()\r\n#5  0x000056067f415cb1 in VlWorkerThread::workerLoop() ()\r\n#6  0x00007feceb8f0e95 in std::execute_native_thread_routine (__p=<optimized out>)\r\n    at ../../../../../libstdc++-v3/src/c++11/thread.cc:104\r\n#7  0x00007feceb5da55a in ??

The thread calling eval() provides one of those threads, and the generated model will create and manage the other N-1 threads.\r\n> ...\r\n> When making frequent use of DPI imported functions in a multithreaded model, it may be beneficial to performance to adjust the [--instr-count-dpi](https://veripool.org/guide/latest/exe_verilator.html#cmdoption-instr-count-dpi) option based on some experimentation. This influences the partitioning of the model by adjusting the assumed execution time of DPI imports.\r\n\r\nAnd the latter bit suggests to me that while under some conditions the DPI functions may be called from the same threads, I see no guarantees that DPI from the `always` blocks in a module will be called using the same thread as the `initial` blocks (which the current implementation implicitly assumes). I suspect that one more degree of refinement around \"the model's threads ought to be more compatible with the fesvr's coroutine implementation backing the DPI SimNetwork implementation\" would help here, not least in identifying whether this is even a crash that chipyard itself has any leverage over.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this here because I believe it's the right home for this issue, since it seems that even if verilator or fesvr exposed a callback or config option that would affect the outcome there'd still need to be a change here in chipyard to take advantage of it, but I'm very new to this space and would welcome your guidance.",

The VM is accessed via a SSH connection from VScode.\nGcc was installed as via \"sudo apt install gcc\"\n\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen I try to compile the file chipyard/tests/nvdla.c, I have errors:  <riscv-pk/encoding.h>: No such file or directory\nas well as warnings that stdio.h is not included.\n\nCan someone please modify that code until it is possible to compile the file nvdla.c without having warnings?\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe file nvdla.c is compiled without warnings. The test nvdla.c can be executed.\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

Stable version seems not working when I try to complie Rocket-Chip with Boom Core, following the instruction in the document. The Config file which defining the SmallBoomConfig is missing.

I think if board's config does not have `WithNoDebug`, it supports JTAG.\r\nHowever, VCU118 does include `WithNoDebug` and the exception occurs when I build the bistream after removing that config.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\nIs JTAG not available yet?\r\nIf it is available, how can I set or modify the code?\r\nIf it is not available, what's your plan for it?\n\n### Other

I have not been able to find other repos that publicly use hwacha nor have I found any documentation on adding hwacha to a rocket core within chipyard that demonstrates how to instantiate a \"hwacha\" object. Rocket-chip by default uses hardfloat, but hardfloat is already included within the rocket-chip file, where as hwacha is not.\r\n\r\nI have also tried moving the hwacha file to the Rocket-chip file, but that just causes all sorts of package namespace issues, and am also pretty confident that that is not the correct way to instantiate a hwacha module. \r\n\r\nSort of stumped. Would really appreciate some help. Thanks\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nverilator make runs fine and executres custom hwacha opcodes/tests.\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

However, if `source /home/eecs/abe.gonzalez/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` (or it's equivalent) isn't set up in the shell it will error saying there is no `conda` command. Sometimes this is due to users having a non-interactive bash setup v.s. an interactive one. This can be solved by adding `source /home/eecs/abe.gonzalez/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` to the `env.sh`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when running `build-setup.sh` multiple times, the `conda activate ...` will be appended multiple times to the file causing slow `env.sh` source times. This can be solved by doing what `conda` does by having a the setup scripts check the `env.sh` file for specific sections and replacing them if they exist (instead of appending).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSee above.\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

Other Setup\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nNote the help text:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./simulator-chipyard.harness-RocketConfig-debug --help\r\n[UART] UART0 is here

EMULATOR OPTIONS no longer shows the command line options like --cycle-count, --vcd, etc.:\r\n```\r\nEMULATOR OPTIONS\r\n  Consult emulator.cc if using Verilator or VCS documentation if using VCS\r\n    for available options.\r\n```\r\nHowever, when checking emulator.cc, I can clearly see the command line options that are expected:\r\n```c\r\nstatic void usage(const char * program_name)\r\n{\r\n  printf(\"Usage: %s [EMULATOR OPTION]...

At the bottom, I see an error:\r\n```\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::invalid_argument'\r\n  what():  User queried htif_t help text\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, 3. using the command line options that are described in emulator.cc, and that _used_ to work, are no longer recognized.

I think something is going wrong in the marshal step, but I don't know what or how to find the issue.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFile should be 30MiB large, I can put it on the SD card and boot Linux to run my tests on Gemmini.\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

It should be noted that no problem is observed when `UInt` data type is supplied to `Queue`. The main issue is that the flow for `SInt`-based Queue is broken.\r\n\r\nPlease see [this](https://github.com/milovanovic/chipyard/tree/1.9.0_queue) for more details on how to reproduce the error.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nGenerates Verilog for `Queue` peripheral with `SInt` (or `FixedPoint`) input data type, just as it does for `UInt`.\r\n\r\nOn Chipyard version [1.8.1](https://github.com/milovanovic/chipyard/tree/1.8.1_queue) everything worked as expected.\n\n### Other Information\n\nSee Chipyard [v1.9.0](https://github.com/milovanovic/chipyard/tree/1.9.0_queue) to reproduce the SInt Queue error.\r\n\r\nSee Chipyard [v1.8.1](https://github.com/milovanovic/chipyard/tree/1.8.1_queue) to observe the expected behavior.",

Before running the script, I made two preparations: first, I created a new env.h file in nvdla-base directory, which specifies the path of liunx, and its content is as follows:\r\n```\r\nexport FIREMARSHAL_LINUX_SRC=$PWD/../../firemarshal/boards/default/linux\r\nexport LINUXSRC=$FIREMARSHAL_LINUX_SRC\r\n```\r\nSecondly, I switched the branch in Linux to nvdla-linux-v57.\r\nBut when I run build-kmd.sh, the error is as follows:\r\n```\r\n(firemarshal) yyx@yyx-virtual-machine:~/riscv/projects/chipyard/software/nvdla-workload/nvdla-base$ source env.sh \r\n(firemarshal)

they are not executing properly.\r\n```\r\n(/home/sen/chipyard/.conda-env) sen@2102c8722001:~/chipyard/sims/verilator$ ./simulator-chipyard-CustomGemminiSoCConfig  pk -p a.out \r\nThis emulator compiled with JTAG Remote Bitbang client. To enable, use +jtag_rbb_enable=1.\r\nListening on port 32983\r\n[UART] UART0 is here (stdin/stdout).\r\nbbl loader\r\n```\r\nI will describe exactly what happened. When I run the program in proxy kernel mode, the program runs very slowly and it takes a long time before the bbl loader appears. After that there is no output.Although this is `gemmini's` emulator, I think it might be a chipyard problem,and it should take longer to get a reply from gemmini.Or there may be experienced people here to help me.In the baremetal environment, there is no problem, and it runs successfully in a while.I really hope someone can help me solve this problem.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe program runs successfully.\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

The serial-tl is attached to FBUS as a master, and normally _tohost_ and _fromhost_ are cacheable, therefore to make sure the commnication between fesvr and DUT work normally, a coherent memory configuration must be provided so that the access from fesvr can probe caches in tile, if you do not want to have L2 cache, you should at least instantiate a _TLBroadcast_, and no _TLCacheCork_ should be injected into the Tile<->SBUS boundary. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMaybe it is better to document or note somewhere that if you want to using the default simulation setup, you should make your memory system coherent. \n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

Documentation Followed / etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nI want to evaluate a 32bit deisgn  configuration(just add `WithRV32 `in the `RocketVCU118Config`) on vcu118. I thought this is a reasonable try. \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass WithRV32 extends Config((site, here, up) => {\r\n  case XLen => 32\r\n  case RocketTilesKey => up(RocketTilesKey, site) map { r =>\r\n    r.copy(core = r.core.copy(\r\n      fpu = r.core.fpu.map(_.copy(fLen = 32)),\r\n      mulDiv = Some(MulDivParams(mulUnroll = 8))))\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\nAlso I changed the sbboot bootrom  Makefile so that the default botrom is compiled as a rv32 program: \r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=-march=rv32imac -mcmodel=medany -O2 -std=gnu11 -Wall -nostartfiles\r\nCFLAGS+= -fno-common -g -mabi=ilp32 -DNONSMP_HART=0\r\n```\r\nAlso, it seems that gcc toolchain provided by chipyard 1.8.0 does not have multilib support by default, therefore I changed  the RISCV variable to a gcc toolchian (downloaded from sifive websitw)with multilib support, and run the make flow. The bitstream and sdboot bin file are generated without errors. But after program it down to the vcu119 board, the uart console on host(baudrate set to 115200) does not display anything.  But when I remove the `WithRV32 ` config fragment(and changed the sdboot makefile back), the UART console display the process of booting correctly. \r\nTherefore I wonder what can be done to support 32bit configuration on vcu118. Is there any further tweaks needs to be done. \r\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nRV32 configuration should be working on vcu118 prototyping\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Re-declaration is a warning and overrides the previous definition instead.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1457\" alt=\"SS 2023-04-15 at 19 16 27\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9910987/232263681-5873ed3e-93a2-4b45-b9e1-b68a62194772.png\">\r\n\n\n### Other Information\n\nNot really a bug, but I'm trying to figure out how to resolve this.\r\nBased on some experiments it seems like this is caused by the omission of `-top TestDriver` in VCS command options. In the previous version of Chipyard `-top TestDriver` is specified. Not sure why this changes an error to a warning.\r\n\r\nCommit 83764d3 modified `sim.mk` to [dump out `sim-inputs.yml` without `tb_name`](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/blob/10c26250c8ad71a6bb7ff5c30f365f8655338c8f/vlsi/sim.mk#L11), which removes the `-top <>` option from VCS invocation when running `make sim-rtl`.\r\n@harrisonliew What is the reason for this? And is there a way to specify `-top`? I tried setting `sim.inputs.tb_name` in my yaml but it looks like `sim-inputs.yml` takes precedence.\r\n\r\nI know I can try to avoid having duplicated definitions but it's often involving PDKs so takes more work to resolve.\r\n",

    "description": "### Background Work\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, I searched the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chipyard)\r\n- [X] Yes, I searched the [documentation](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/)\r\n\r\n### Feature Description\r\n\r\nWith the migration to CIRCT, modules in the hierarchy are now individually in their own Verilog files. However, modules that are common to the top and model's hierarchy are not uniquified. After the top is synthesized, those modules will collide with the same modules in the model's hierarchy, causing simulation to fail.\r\n\r\nFor now, this commit avoids module collisions: https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/pull/1369/commits/08839930009a6f15f2b3ba73940c243d34750ab6 but the proper fix is to uniquify modules that are common to the top/model into separate files.\r\n\r\nWhen this \"bug\" is fixed, this hack can be removed.\r\n\r\n### Motivating Example\r\n\r\nGate-level simulation is altered due to this \"bug\". If synthesized modules are referenced in the model's hierarchy and timing annotation is turned on, it is uncertain if the timing at the top/model boundary will still be OK. Regardless, a testbench should be fully behavioral.",

    "description": "### Background Work\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, I searched the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chipyard)\r\n- [X] Yes, I searched [prior issues](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/issues)\r\n- [X] Yes, I searched the [documentation](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/)\r\n\r\n### Chipyard Version and Hash\r\n\r\nRelease: main\r\nHash: 4f74f29724e15f495c6cac12fef10f0f0d23797f\r\n\r\n### OS Setup\r\n\r\nmacOS 13.2.1\r\n\r\n### Other Setup\r\n\r\nCheck out fresh Chipyard, run ./scripts/init-submodules-no-riscv-tools.sh\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nIf you build the default `RocketConfig` with and without `ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS=1`, you will get different RTL at the end. I haven't exhaustively checked the differences, but I can see that when `ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS=1`, the SRAMs in `top.mems.conf` are much narrower.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make -C sims/vcs ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS=1 verilog\r\n...\r\n$ mv sims/vcs/generated-src sims/vcs/generated-src.custom-firrtl-pass-enabled/\r\n$ make -C sims/vcs verilog\r\n...\r\n$ cat sims/vcs/generated-src/chipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig/chipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig.top.mems.conf\r\nname cc_dir_ext depth 1024 width 136 ports mrw mask_gran 17\r\nname cc_banks_0_ext depth 16384 width 64 ports rw\r\nname data_arrays_0_ext depth 512 width 256 ports mrw mask_gran 8\r\nname tag_array_ext depth 64 width 88 ports mrw mask_gran 22\r\nname tag_array_0_ext depth 64 width 84 ports mrw mask_gran 21\r\nname data_arrays_0_0_ext depth 512 width 128 ports mrw mask_gran 32\r\n$ cat sims/vcs/generated-src.custom-firrtl-pass-enabled/chipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig/chipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig.top.mems.conf\r\nname cc_dir_0_ext depth 1024 width 17 ports mrw mask_gran 17\r\nname cc_banks_0_ext depth 16384 width 64 ports rw\r\nname data_arrays_0_0_ext depth 512 width 8 ports mrw mask_gran 8\r\nname tag_array_0_ext depth 64 width 22 ports mrw mask_gran 22\r\nname tag_array_0_0_ext depth 64 width 21 ports mrw mask_gran 21\r\nname data_arrays_0_0_0_ext depth 512 width 32 ports mrw mask_gran 32\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that each SRAM is much narrower (the `width` field is smaller) for the design where `ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS=1`. It looks like the design instantiates several parallel instances of each SRAM to make up the same design as when `ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS` is unset.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the two designs are functionally identical, but even if they are, using narrower SRAMs could be a problem if users were hoping to use particular foundry SRAMs with wider entries.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the `ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS=1` build to produce the same Verilog for the `RocketConfig` as when `ENABLE_CUSTOM_FIRRTL_PASS` is unset.\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nI think this is the same issue as noted here: https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/pull/1239#issuecomment-1289614527",

reinstall gcc toolchain following these https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-tools-feedstock directions - appeared to not do anything? Also removed chipyard entirely, reinstalled, and tried again, which also didn't work.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nChipyard successfully generates verilog RTL, then goes into the vcs simulation script and appears to get most of the way through the simulation setup process before attempting to create executables (presumably using the riscv gcc compiler? not entirely certain if it's making riscv executables to run on the simulated chip or making x86_64 executables to run on the host machine) and then exiting because ld fails to find -lnuma and exits with status 1, which causes the make run (run by `make CONFIG=TapeoutDoubleMedConfig`) to exit with status 2.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is for ld to find -lnuma and therefore not fail.\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nerror:\r\n```bash\r\n/afs/ece.cmu.edu/usr/ngaertne/725/chipyard/.conda-env/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/12.1.0/../../../../x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lnuma\r\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\nmake[1]: *** [Makefile:118: product_timestamp] Error 1\r\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/afs/ece.cmu.edu/usr/ngaertne/725/chipyard/sims/vcs/generated-src/chipyard.TestHarness.TapeoutDoubleMedConfig/chipyard.TestHarness.TapeoutDoubleMedConfig'\r\nMake exited with status 2\r\nmake: *** [Makefile:72: /afs/ece.cmu.edu/usr/ngaertne/725/chipyard/sims/vcs/simv-chipyard-TapeoutDoubleMedConfig] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nconfig: \r\n```scala\r\nclass TapeoutDoubleMedConfig extends Config(\r\n  new freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.WithNMedCores(2) ++             // two medium rocket-cores\r\n  new freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.WithNBanks(2) ++                // two cache banks\r\n  new ChaCha.withChaCha ++                                                              //add custom accelerator\r\n  new freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.WithCoherentBusTopology ++     // coherent bus\r\n  new testchipip.WithRingSystemBus ++                               // Ring-topology system bus\r\n//  new freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.WithNoMemPort ++ // no external memory port\r\n//  new testchipip.WithBackingScratchpad ++                   // add mbus backing scratchpad\r\n  new chipyard.config.AbstractConfig)\r\n```",

If you look in `tools/barstools/target`, there's a `scala-2.12` directory. I've got a project with some custom FIRRTL transforms which the `tapeout` project must depend on, and since `barstools` runs with Scala 2.12, my project must also run with Scala 2.12. I'd like to upgrade it to Scala 2.13 :)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBarstools uses Scala 2.13 like the other Chipyard sub-projects.\r\n\r\nI put together this PR for barstools which should resolve the problem: https://github.com/ucb-bar/barstools/pull/127\n\n### Other Information\n\n_No response_",

It looks like we'll need an extra `scalac` option to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, take this code snippet from [the Chisel Hierarchy Cookbook](https://www.chisel-lang.org/chisel3/docs/cookbooks/hierarchy.html#using-definition-and-instance), and place it at the end of `generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/example/GCD.scala`:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.{Definition, Instance, instantiable, public}\r\n\r\n@instantiable\r\nclass AddOne(width: Int) extends Module {\r\n  @public val in  = IO(Input(UInt(width.W)))\r\n  @public val out = IO(Output(UInt(width.W)))\r\n  out := in + 1.U\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass AddTwo(width: Int) extends Module {\r\n  val in  = IO(Input(UInt(width.W)))\r\n  val out = IO(Output(UInt(width.W)))\r\n  val addOneDef = Definition(new AddOne(width))\r\n  val i0 = Instance(addOneDef)\r\n  val i1 = Instance(addOneDef)\r\n  i0.in := in\r\n  i1.in := i0.out\r\n  out   := i1.out\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry to compile, and you should see these errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] compiling 1 Scala source to /path/to/chipyard/generators/chipyard/target/scala-2.13/classes ...\r\n[error] /path/to/chipyard/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/example/GCD.scala:224:6: value in is not a member of chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Instance[chipyard.example.AddOne]\r\n[error] did you mean isA?\r\n[error]   i0.in := in\r\n[error]      ^\r\n[error] /path/to/chipyard/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/example/GCD.scala:225:6: value in is not a member of chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Instance[chipyard.example.AddOne]\r\n[error] did you mean isA?\r\n[error]   i1.in := i0.out\r\n[error]      ^\r\n[error] /path/to/chipyard/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/example/GCD.scala:225:15: value out is not a member of chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Instance[chipyard.example.AddOne]\r\n[error]   i1.in := i0.out\r\n[error]               ^\r\n[error] /path/to/chipyard/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/example/GCD.scala:226:15: value out is not a member of chisel3.experimental.hierarchy.Instance[chipyard.example.AddOne]\r\n[error]   out   := i1.out\r\n[error]               ^\r\n[error] four errors found\r\n[error] (Compile / compileIncremental) Compilation failed\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect the above code to compile without error. In fact, if you add `\"-Ymacro-annotations\"` to `scalacOptions` in `build.sbt`, the build works.

Consider this test C program (which I placed in `tests/hello.c`):\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint main() {\r\n    return -1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI built this program with `make -C tests hello.riscv`.\r\n\r\nWhen running with Verilator (`make -C sims/verilator run-binary CONFIG=RocketConfig BINARY=/path/to/chipyard/tests/hello.riscv`), the stderr log file (`sims/verilator/output/chipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig/hello.out`) ends with these two lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** FAILED *** (tohost = -1)\r\n*** FAILED *** (code = -1, seed 1670529991) after 10634 cycles\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the process exits with status `2`, so a shell process can tell the test failed.\r\n\r\nWhen running with VCS (`make -C sims/vcs run-binary CONFIG=RocketConfig BINARY=/path/to/chipyard/tests/hello.riscv`), the stderr log file (`sims/vcs/output/chipyard.TestHarness.RocketConfig/hello.out`) ends with these two lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** FAILED *** (tohost = -1)\r\n*** PASSED *** Completed after                11313 simulation cycles\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the process exits with status `0`, so a shell process _can't_ tell the test failed.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe VCS simulation should behave the same as the Verilator simulation: it should report the failure cause, and exit with a non-zero status code.\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nSome background on why this happens: The Verilator and VCS simulations are driven by two different testbench files (although perhaps that will change after #1263 is resolved). The Verilator simulation is driven by [`emulator.cc`](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/blob/43b75640cc5f5c95ede218e53f39976a96623c0f/generators/chipyard/src/main/resources/csrc/emulator.cc) in the Chipyard repo, while the VCS simulation is driven by [`TestDriver.v`](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/21722ddd51957f43b933f910f34b9c645fa54226/src/main/resources/vsrc/TestDriver.v) in the rocket-chip repo.\r\n\r\nAs I recall, returning a non-zero exit code from a C program causes the RISC-V core to write the exit code to a special `tohost` memory-mapped address, which causes the [FESVR](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim) to interpret that data as a system call, and [print this error message](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim/blob/9b074198357b77189df989f0e274b23353f7f528/fesvr/syscall.cc#L204) (which we see as the second-to-last line in both simulation logs).\r\n\r\n### Verilator\r\n\r\n[This code at the end of `emulator.cc`](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/blob/43b75640cc5f5c95ede218e53f39976a96623c0f/generators/chipyard/src/main/resources/csrc/emulator.cc#L363-L386) checks for the various causes of why the test might halt, and reports the exit code. Note that this file is directly interrogating `tsi->exit_code()`, and using that to set the exit status.\r\n\r\n### VCS\r\n\r\nThe signals of interest in `TestDriver.v` are [`failure` and `success`](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/21722ddd51957f43b933f910f34b9c645fa54226/src/main/resources/vsrc/TestDriver.v#L116-L117). Note that both of them are 1-bit signals. The `failure` signal is [only written after a simulation timeout](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/21722ddd51957f43b933f910f34b9c645fa54226/src/main/resources/vsrc/TestDriver.v#L137-L141), so that's the only way to have the VCS simulation report a non-zero exit code.\r\n\r\nThe `success` signal also causes the simulation to end, but [the result is the test-passed message and a `0` exit code](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/21722ddd51957f43b933f910f34b9c645fa54226/src/main/resources/vsrc/TestDriver.v#L150-L160). The `success` signal is driven by the `TestHarness` module, and has a variety of drivers depending on how the DUT is set up. However, those drivers can only ever tell the `TestHarness` to pass the test, never to fail it (or what the failure cause was).\r\n\r\nFor this particular test, the test is finished when the [`SimSerial`](https://github.com/ucb-bar/testchipip/blob/f99b1eb59a34d7934059904f03237d5bc8d4a680/src/main/resources/testchipip/vsrc/SimSerial.v) module in the testchipip repo reports an exit code from [the TSI block](https://github.com/ucb-bar/testchipip/blob/f99b1eb59a34d7934059904f03237d5bc8d4a680/src/main/resources/testchipip/csrc/SimSerial.cc). However, `SimSerial` [only gets the LSB of the TSI's exit code](https://github.com/ucb-bar/testchipip/blob/f99b1eb59a34d7934059904f03237d5bc8d4a680/src/main/resources/testchipip/vsrc/SimSerial.v#L65), so it doesn't know if TSI wants the test to pass or fail.\r\n\r\n### Path Forward\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly how we want to resolve this lack-of-information getting to `TestDriver.v`, but here is a possibility.\r\n\r\n- Change the interface between `SimSerial` and the `TestHarness` infrastructure, so we don't just have a `success` signal to drive, but perhaps a `finish` bit and `exit_code` value. Then `TestDriver` could examine the two together, and determine if the test should pass or fail.\r\n- This would require changing `SimSerial` to read the entirety of `__exit` from TSI. Additionally, we'd have to update some of the `TestHarness`/`HarnessBinders` code to use these new `finish`/`exit_code` signals. Finally, we'd have to update `TestDriver` to interpret these signals appropriately and print out the right message (similar to the simulation-finish logic at the end of `emulator.cc`). This might be the most painful part, since this would involve a rocket-chip bump, and those are significantly more involved.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are other ways to solve this problem, and potentially some use-cases that I'm not considering, so I'd love to hear what other suggestions you have. I'm happy to drive forward progress on resolving this. Thanks!",

    "description": "### Background Work\n\n- [X] Yes, I searched the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chipyard)\n- [X] Yes, I searched [prior issues](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/issues)\n- [X] Yes, I searched the [documentation](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/)\n\n### Chipyard Version and Hash\n\nRelease: 1.8.1\r\nChipyard Hash: 004297 \r\nBoom Hash: fac2c3\n\n### OS Setup\n\nUbuntu 20.04.5 LTS\n\n### Other Setup\n\nI followed the [documention](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to set up the directory.\r\n\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nHello, \r\nI hope this is the right place for my issue but if I should move the discussion to elsewhere feel free to point me to the right place. \r\nI am trying to run the MediumBoom Config on the VCU118 FPGA with the fpga-shells support provided in this repository. After adding configs for SmallBoomConfig and MediumBoomConfig to chipyard/fpga/src/main/scala/vcu118/Configs.scala I successfully created bitstreams for both versions.\r\nThe SmallBoom bitstream boots Linux as expected without any issues. \r\nHowever, MediumBoom interrupts the boot process and seems to hang. \r\nI tried simulating the booting with vcs and it shows the same behavior (see attached br-base-no-disk.log). \r\nSo it seems to me as if this is not necessarily an fpga specific issue.\r\nRunning the simulation in debug mode shows a WFI uop at ROB head but I was not able to track down the cause (yet).\r\nWhat's very confusing to me: when running the flow earlier this year on the zcu104 the MediumBoom proceeded to boot but threw a lot of segmentation faults because of what I thought were timing closure/ congestion issues because of high CLB usage (see [mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/g/chipyard/c/islBKMgalRQ/m/WrDgZaJeBAAJ)). \r\nThe versiones used back then were: \r\nChipyard version: 4180463d52bc0a6b4c004530601ccdabebf0ab7d\r\nBOOM Version: 1ad28828673f2fce7a18f7255facd4705f04a58a\r\nbut downgrading to those versions did not help with the current issue.\r\nI was not able to generate the bitstream exactly at those hashes because the SNAPSHOT versions in the build.sbt throw errors. \r\nDoes anyone have a working chipyard/boom combination that can boot Linux on the vcu118 in the MediumBoom configuration?\r\nCan somebody reproduce/confirm this issue? \r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect the MediumBoom configuration to be able to boot Linux. \n\n### Other Information\n\n[br-base-bin-nodisk.log](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/files/10123416/br-base-bin-nodisk.log)\r\n",

(it is compiled wo problems)\r\nfirstly, the code automatically branches to jtag boot process.\r\nThen, I changed the bootmode=spi_flash in testbench.. so it had to brach here. \r\nbut this time, the sim stucks on tb line 767  (Waiting for end of computation)\r\nand inherintly,  there is not any transition on spi sgnals.. \r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nSorry, the problem is that I did not know that I should update the boot_code.cde in sim folder after I changed the boot code.\r\nSo now, I can see the boot process is starting and running till the wait_clock_refrence().\r\nHowever, the core is stuck here. Because, as far as I see, the wait_for_interrupt() subroutine does not return successfully.\r\n\r\nI have checked the itc functions and compared them to the old version.

So I can only download all files one by one according to the list in _ips_list.yml_. I want to know, if I want to switch between different cores, do I only need to modify the parameter in pulpissimo.sv? In addition, during the synthesis process, the tool reported some bit-width mismatches and timing loop problems. It seems that the code seems to be a bit problematic or I miss some macros? \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68361958/88885863-ded42480-d26b-11ea-8a50-e6e87a626e95.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68361958/88885923-00351080-d26c-11ea-8a30-62b7e241397c.png)\r\n",

    "description": "Dear all,\r\nin the pad frame you find the following lines of code in the latest master commit:\r\n```\r\n    pad_functional_pu padinst_i2c0_sda   (.OEN(~oe_i2c0_sda_i  ), .I(out_i2c0_sda_i  ), .O(in_i2c0_sda_o  ), .PAD(pad_i2c0_sda  ), .PEN(~pad_cfg_i[7][0] ) );\r\n    pad_functional_pu padinst_i2c0_scl   (.OEN(~oe_i2c0_scl_i  ), .I(out_i2c0_scl_i  ), .O(in_i2c0_scl_o  ), .PAD(pad_i2c0_scl  ), .PEN(~pad_cfg_i[8][0] ) );\r\n```\r\nAccording to these lines, i2c0_sda should be pad_cfg[7] and i2c0_scl should be pad_cfg[8]. If you now have a look into pad_control.sv, you see that both vectors are generated either by using the pad configuration register [7] or [8] or the gpio configuration register [7] or [8]:\r\n```\r\n   assign pad_cfg_o[7]  = (pad_mux_i[7]  == 2'b01) ? gpio_cfg_i[7]  : pad_cfg_i[7];\r\n   assign pad_cfg_o[8]  = (pad_mux_i[8]  == 2'b01) ? gpio_cfg_i[8]  : pad_cfg_i[8];\r\n```\r\nNow, what is strange is that for the other gpio registers (direction, input, output) it seems 7 and 8 are mapped to the uart rx/tx pins:\r\n```\r\n   assign out_uart_rx_o    = (pad_mux_i[7 ] == 2'b00) ? 1'b0               : ((pad_mux_i[7 ] == 2'b01) ? gpio_out_i[7 ] : ((pad_mux_i[7 ] == 2'b10) ? i2c1_sda_out_i : s_alt3 ));\r\n   assign out_uart_tx_o    = (pad_mux_i[8 ] == 2'b00) ? uart_tx_i          : ((pad_mux_i[8 ] == 2'b01) ? gpio_out_i[8 ] : ((pad_mux_i[8 ] == 2'b10) ? i2c1_scl_out_i : s_alt3 ));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the UART RX/TX configurations come from pad_cfg_i[33] and pad_cfg[34]:\r\n```\r\n    pad_functional_pu padinst_uart_rx    (.OEN(~oe_uart_rx_i   ), .I(out_uart_rx_i   ), .O(in_uart_rx_o   ), .PAD(pad_uart_rx   ), .PEN(~pad_cfg_i[33][0]) );\r\n    pad_functional_pu padinst_uart_tx    (.OEN(~oe_uart_tx_i   ), .I(out_uart_tx_i   ), .O(in_uart_tx_o   ), .PAD(pad_uart_tx   ), .PEN(~pad_cfg_i[34][0]) );\r\n```\r\nThey are based on gpio_cfg_i[26] and [27].\r\n```\r\n   assign pad_cfg_o[33] = (pad_mux_i[33] == 2'b01) ? gpio_cfg_i[26] : pad_cfg_i[33];\r\n   assign pad_cfg_o[34] = (pad_mux_i[34] == 2'b01) ? gpio_cfg_i[27] : pad_cfg_i[34];\r\n```\r\nThat means to configure GPIO mode of UART RX/TX I need to set up gpio_out[7,8], gpio_dir[7,8] but gpio_cfg[26,27]. For i2c0 it is mixed up, too.\r\n\r\nIs this the intended behaviour or did I miss something here?\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nDustin",
